"Am currently an undergraduate which will be enrolling into university next year. Currently having troubles deciding which of the two degrees I am more interested in: Software Engineering or Information systems.

I have been trying to learn programming in my free time for about 3 months now, and found out that web dev doesn't interest me that much as I found the content and building websites a little to dry to my liking. Have been considering to take an Information System degree instead , which is a hybrid degree in my local university that comprises of the disciplines from both business and programming.

Would love to know more about the following content:

What are the differences between majoring in business analytics and fintech? i.e what are the different things that you would learn, different career pathways that you have between taking the two majors.

What are the questions that you would ask yourself to know which between the two majors, biz analytics or fintech, is your desired cup of tea?

Could I know more about the type of jobs that fintech/biz analytics industry has to offer and the type of jobs that you guys currently have? (or know someone else that is in any of the above mentioned industries)  Description of jobs, working hours, working culture, pay range would be nice so that I can get a better idea of what people in each of the industry do.

Thank you all for reading and hope to read about your experience in the fintech/biz analytics industry! Cheers :)"
