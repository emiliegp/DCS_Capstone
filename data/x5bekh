Card on file changer - experiences?
2022-09-04 12:19:03
I just saw [KnotAPI](https://knotapi.com) on Linkedin and it looks interesting to say the least. Reminds me of plaid in the early days. Has anyone here worked with them or integrated their product?
"['The problem with card-on-file is that for the brand (visa, mc, etc) to properly detect a subscription, it needs the merchant to properly flag it. This doesnâ€™t happen all the time. For example, Visa Card-on-file API has a success of under 50% (meaning it will return less than have the subscriptions a card is saved). Because of this you have companies like First Performance which takes the historic transaction data (13 months at least) and will move the success rate to 80-90%). \n\nAfter that, then you can check migration solutions such as Knot or Card Dynamics which are integrated with major merchants to allow migrating a subscription from one card to another. Bottom line is, changing card-on-file is not as simple as it looks.', ""No, but it's an interesting space, cardswap by q2 and strivve are some other very similar tools. But from what I understand utilization of the tools is very low from a consumer at a bank pov.\n\n I'm more interested by the visa token service and tokenization across these providers.  As well as virtual/ digital cards that companies like capital one create for you on checkout/payment. I think that's where payments are heading.""]"
