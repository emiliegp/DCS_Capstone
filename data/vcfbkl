Does bridging crypto between accounts owned by the same individual qualify for a money transmitter license exemption?

"Considering all AML and KYC precautions are properly done, would the service of bridging assets such as cryptocurrencies, between accounts owned by the same individual, be qualified as an exemption?

&#x200B;

One example would be bridging USDC from the user's Ethereum account to their Solana account.

&#x200B;

If it doesn't qualify as an exemption, are there any BaaS or service that enables fintech startups to get off the ground without licenses in all states it operates?"
