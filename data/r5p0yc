How do multiple TIMEZONEs and REGIONAL holidays affect your systems?

"Hi there,

How do you people handle different time zones and regional holidays? In particular, regarding the EoD process, penalties for late payments, interest calculation?  


The idea is to store everything as UTC in the DATABASE and show the time according to the user's TZ. That's the easy part! But what about running the EOD process? If we run it on a specific time zone, it might not be a good fit for people in a different TZ, as it might be too early or too late. 

I know we can have a lot of CONDITIONALS in our systems, but I would like to hear from you guys about a more elegant way of handling these variations.  


I am working for a Canadian institution, and I am not yet familiar with the Canadian Market. 

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks"
"[""It depends on how international your customers are but generally the timezones used for specific uses (interest, billing etc.) will be defined in the contract or T&C's."", 'Why not say something like this,\n\n“Deadline is 5:00pm UTC” \n\nThen maybe link to a time conversion calculator.', 'My former company was based on the East Coast so all EODs was on EST and we had users all over the country and in Canada, as well. Using one centralized time zone made it a lot easier. I believe they were even messages in the system saying “all payments must be made by 6 PM EST or will be considered late” or something. Idk if that helps at all but it wasn’t an issue for us.']"
