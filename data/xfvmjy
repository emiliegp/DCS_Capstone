CAC and LTV monitoring - measurement tools and granularity level

"We are a Fintech company offering financial products to SMBs.
We find it increasingly challenging to employ a systematic/quantitative approach to calculating CAC and LTV across various channels of customer acquisition. 
We currently use BI tools built in house but they are limited in the granularity of analysis, ability to dissect and link campaigns and revenue - making them ok for directional reporting but not to good enough to optimize spend. 

What’s your situation ? Approach ?"
"['If I am clear you are looking for a specific tool?\n\nMy opinion of the situation:\n\nI think this would be hard without you putting the effort into yourself as most tools always have limitations.  Your internal BI linking stuff is the right approach, you just need to make sure all the data is being captured for now or at least dumped into a warehouse and relatable to the source. In a little bit of time once you feel a sample size is big enough you need to put a pause on activities and play with the data further enhancing your BI portal to answer questions/metrics tracking you want to be addressed to help make strategic decisions, in all honesty, you will need to visit the questions you are answering / metrics tracked as time goes by due to changing direction, market conditions, and realizations looking at the data.\n\nRandom idea:\n\nIf you want to make the process easy there are dime a dozen data analytics/science startups that are struggling to get customers, you could get hold of one and do a POC, outsourcing the automation definition part to them. If you want DM me I know someone who approached me I can refer them.', ""I'd split this problem in two:\n\n* setup (determining what cost goes where, marketing campaigns, ads, targeting, revenue, etc.)\n* monthly/weekly updates.\n\nIf you limit setup part to a scope of third-party integrations (like Mixpanel, GA, Ads, FB, LI,  Stripe, etc.) you'd be able to get a better grasp on it."", 'Where do you store your data? A single database perhaps? PostgreSQL? \n\nA bit more context would help.', 'Rockerbox  + Excel / BI', 'We use Postgres + Skowflake .\nThank you', 'Ok, so the setup is not bad. I would default to plain SQL then. Is that something you are already doing?', 'Doing a couple is SQLs and discount back is what we do now. It doesn’t cut it because the scale is large enough so we need to get granular. For example we would like to view the #s by campaign, segment, credit data etc. \nwhat do u do ?', 'SQL tbh. What is the exact problem with SQL?']"
