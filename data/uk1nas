"Hey, redditors of the world!  
Right now due to war in Ukraine thousands of developers have lost their jobs. I with my fellow coworkers from Ukraine have created a community of mid to senior level developers (DeFi, web-dev, ML, etc.) of more than 1200 people. The main asset of our community is speed - we have a great team of PMs, so any task can be distributed between many people and can be done faster than you could imagine - motivation it is x)  
Now we are looking for outsourcing opportunities for them. We can address fixing some parts of your projects as well as developing it from scratch.
