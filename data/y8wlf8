"['Wow', 'I am just going to repost what I wrote from my M2020 experience. This whole thing is just absolutely disgusting. No one should do business with MX anymore. I don\'t let my bank work with hypocrites because they tend to stab you in the back at some point. \n\n""MX. Because it was not the MX I was used to. In fact, I am recommending we not renew our contract with MX and move in a different direction.\n\nI\'ll be frank, MX has got to be either ignorant or stupid, maybe both. MX had RIF/layoffs of 200+ people yet their new CEO keeps going off about the MX Mission. MFer its a bit hypocritical to talk about how you will make people financially strong when my sales rep, customer service rep, their managers, and their managers\' managers have all been let go and are no longer at the company AND you did it right before the Holiday season. Thats not who I signed up to do business with. Now, no one seems to care for my company and my business. I stopped by Chica where MX was parked to chat with the team and figure out what to do. My bank is worth almost 7 figures worth of business to MX and your team was pitching us hard on your open banking solution this past year.\n\nI think I am going to look at other options now and just rip and replace everything that we do with MX. I already began cursory conversations with my online banking and mobile provider, after my M2020/Chica interaction. It\'s not worth it anymore. MX was like a cult you wanted to be a part of and now the cult has been exposed, kind of like the Mormon church.""']"
