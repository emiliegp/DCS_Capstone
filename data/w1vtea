Green banking? Tickets for Tearsheet's Banking on the Planet Conference

"Where banks lend, money matters. So do the consequences of those lending models. The rising sentiment in the global conversation is that banks must assume accountability for the financial industry’s impact on the environment.

In response, we’ve seen some banks starting to become more transparent in their lending portfolios, and a new sector of fintech rising in dedication to carbon offsetting. A new wave of startups has launched over the past few years targeting the intersection of climate risks, sustainability, ESG, investments, and banking. Some challenger banks, like Aspiration, have designed and marketed their products for the environmentally-conscious consumer, giving rise to an environmentally-infused ethos around banking. And many of the big banks have signed pledges committing to going carbon neutral. 

But how do we move from greenwashing to making a difference?

Tearsheet’s [inaugural Banking on the Planet Conference](https://ti.to/tearsheet/tearsheets-green-finance-conference-2022) brings together leaders from the banks set out to make a difference, and the fintechs and technology providers enabling those promises.

[Join us](https://ti.to/tearsheet/tearsheets-green-finance-conference-2022) virtually at Banking on the Planet Conference 2022 on July 26th for a day of critical dialogue on the responsibility bestowed upon the financial industry, and the players rising to the challenge."
