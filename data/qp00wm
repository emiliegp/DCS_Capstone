"Does anyone know which companies are direct competitors to Marqeta in terms of being able to issue credit cards? For example, if Crypto.com was looking for a partner to launch a credit card with, they might consider Marqeta and who else?"
"['Marqeta does not issue a credit card. If you  go to them for a credit card they push you to Deserve as the program manager. Marqeta just acts as the processing engine behind the program.  \n\n\nDeserve is a program manager that builds ontop of Marqeta or Corecard.   \n\n\nIf you want to issue a credit card here are your options.   \n\n\n1. TSYS (good luck)\n2. i2c\n3. Corecard\n4. Lithic\n5. Deserve\n6. Zeta\n7. Qolo\n8. Synapse (stay away)\n\nsome of the above bring their own bank to the table which makes it significantly easier but also 5x the cost (zeta, deserve, lithic, synapse).   \n\n\nIf you want to build the program yourself and bring your own bank (i2c, corecard, tsys), you will likely spend 9 months and big money building it.', ""SynapseFi have an option for the card issuance:\n\n[https://www.awesomefintech.com/company/synapse-1mmmom/](https://www.awesomefintech.com/company/synapse-1mmmom/)\n\nSame for Galileo:\n\n[https://www.awesomefintech.com/company/galileo-financial-technologies-xd4nln/](https://www.awesomefintech.com/company/galileo-financial-technologies-xd4nln/)\n\nAnd Stripe does it too.\n\nAll of the above can issue a simple debit cards, except for Stripe. \n\nIssuing a credit card with others will require extra hoops, so it will depend on who's your banking partner in this case. Here I've heard good things about Evolve Bank."", 'Lithic', 'Deserve.com powers the BlockFi credit card', 'I2c', ""Oh, I can actually help you with this question with our list of [Marqeta's competitors](http://dashdevs.com/blog/marqeta-card-issuing-and-its-top-10-alternatives-for-modern-payment-solutions-1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=article).

Spill the tea :)', 'EllisWyatt1, detailed response to OP. As a former tech guy who was part of a startup bank, I appreciate your response.', 'I read a bit about CoreCard. They seem like an old player with relatively old tech stack, however they are used by GS/Apple and talk about serving other customers, like crypto platforms, do you know why people choose them, instead of Marqeta or other more modern provider? Thanks', '[deleted]', "">Marqeta's competitors\n\nI have a case testifying your words on 9 months for building the neobank - look at [this](http://dashdevs.com/blog/dozens-from-an-idea-to-the-digital-financial-institution-in-9-months/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=article)! BTW, have a question - which of these credit card issuing providers you'd put into the top-3 list?"", 'Stripe Issuing is a credit card, not a debit card.', 'Very helpful info, man! Thanks, need to look at them closer! Have you tried the former two themselves for your business?', 'I have used them in the past. They are very good to work with.', 'Everyone says they are a disaster and the CEO is off the deep end. We looked at them and their sales team was terrible and unable to really explain the program. I have two friends that tried them and both have switched after less than a year. Apparently they are just terrible to work with', 'Gracias', 'Again,   \n\n\nMarqeta does not do a credit card. If you do a credit card through marqeta they will send you to deserve.   \n\n\ni2c and corecard are the only real players. Corecard is old but cheap and you have full control. Building is not for the faint of heart but worth it in the end. You are correct that the apple card uses it.', '$250k Compliance\n\n$200k on legal\n\n$50k on card printing\n\n$150k on issuer setup\n\n$200k on other systems and security\n\n$100k on processor \n\n$50k on servicing (call center) \n\n$250k origination fee on Receivable financing line\n\n$25k for payments setup\n\n$50k for KYC/fraud \n\nThis also doesn’t take into account the 10+ people to set this up.\n\nThe list goes on from here. To give you an idea of the magnitude, an issuing bank’s due diligence shared drive is usually over 300 items. This will take 4 months minimum. Processors take 3 months minimum and the card network (MC / VISA) are insanely slow. (It took us 3 months for them to turn a document 4 times haha ). Card print is a 4 month setup.\n\nA lot of these can run concurrently, but there are stage gates that must be met before other projects can continue.\n\nTo run them side by side takes a serious effort just from a time commitment standpoint. None of this stuff is necessarily difficult, just wrangling a bunch of really slow companies and making sure you get it right the first time.\n\n\nA certain company not to be named raised $60M and it took them almost two years and roughly 40 people to launch a card. \n\n\nLithic will be expensive but if the credit card isn’t your main product it should be fine. I’m quite sure they take most of the interchange, where most “build it yourself” processors just charge per account. I also don’t think lithic can handle the servicing side (interest calcs and whatnot) so beware of that if so. I2c and corecard are the best options unfortunately for building your own. Qolo is the future, but you need to get an outside servicer for managing the credit program so I wouldn’t try it quite yet. Mess up an interest calc and the CFPB is on your ass. \n\nPlan 3m to get it done on your own from zero. But when it’s done, it’s 80-90% cheaper than deserve, lithic, etc. If a credit card is your main product, you need to build it yourself. (Keep in mind there are less than 10 fintechs that have done this successfully haha)\n\nGood luck!', 'We’re talking about credit cards. Not a depository. Depositories are relatively quick. Usually 3-4 months if you have your shit together', 'thanks, updated my comment.', 'Yeah, we use them in production on several projects.', 'Thanks for comments. Do you think Corecard then would be a good choice for a growing fintech? Or you would go with i2c?', 'Corecard if you have a team that is knowledgeable in CC rules.', 'Got you, thanks!']"
