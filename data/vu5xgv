Banking and Fintech industry-recognized certifications in data storage/security/exchange - which ones are most reputable?
2022-07-08 18:34:59
"Hi redditors,

as banking industry is very regulated, it's obvious that any business which supposes **data exchange** with banks (think of Stripe, Revolut, etc.) is subject to serious compliance checks prior to gaining access to bank data.

What are the certifications these **businesses** should obtain (I'm not talking of *personal* certification here!) to add to their reliability/credibility in the eyes of future partner banks (both European and American ones)?

Thank you for your comments!"
"['PCI, SOC type 1 and 2. If you are processing small number of transactions through Stripe for example you might be fine with a SAQ-D. Check their PCI documentation, it’s very helpful. If you feel you need do a lot more transactions talk to tugboat logic or a very specialized and affordable player like EAmmune.', 'PCI first. For example, Stripe is a PCI Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) and a PCI Level 1 Service Provider. \n\nVarious security certifications will also look good in the eyes of users, as customers want to be confident in the reliability of storing and transferring their sensitive data.', 'https://kodytechnolab.com/blog/robotic-process-automation-in-finance-and-banking-sector/', 'Good input, noted and - thank you! Short summary:\n\n**PCI** (part of which is SAQ-D) is mainly focused on *payment-related* data (e.g., credit card data)\n\n**SOC** is a more ""wide"" thing (it certifies storage of ""customer data"", which might be a big range), so it can be useful for *any* SaaS business. SOC audit is performed by CPA (Certified Public Accountants), so SOC roots are in finances\n\nHowever, are you aware of any certifications (*recognized* of course, not just ""existing in nature""), which are focused on data security as such, without specific focus on finances?\n\nE.g. a company which builds data center, should be (as I see this case) certified not in specifically *customer* data storage, but rather on how secure their servers are and the software they use, etc. Any thoughts on that, maybe?\n\nThank you!', 'I see what your question is. \n\nFirst off, I find that while PCI includes the word “payment” in it, data providers and financial services companies apply it to other data as well, such as bank account numbers, routing numbers etc. and here’s why. \n\nThere is no regulating authority that is going around checking to see if every FinTech, financial services firm or in your case a customer storage provider is PCI certified or meeting SOC standards. \n\nSo companies are self-regulating purely because by doing so they are less likely to make a mistake that might cause them to be investigated by CFPB, SEC, FTC etc. \n\nAs to get a third party to PCI certify the certifying partner will run a pentest or two, review an require you to make changes to your system architecture, data flow, storage methodology etc. Sometimes they might recommend the use of vendors such as Skyflow or VGS to avoid “touching PII or PCI data”. And they can/will extend the definition of PCI to meet your risk level. \n\nDoes that help?', 'Thank you, great input!', 'Yep, it sure helps - thank you a lot! The last one (to call it a day) - any **ISO** certification maybe that comes to your mind? As far as I know different versions (e.g., ISO9000, etc.) exist in quite a lot of industries, so possibly IT data security has its own ISO too...?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**UPD.** Looks like ISO 27001 is what I need.']"
