"Does anyone know what APIs to use to buy/sell stocks? I've read that some apps do it through NYSE but I doubt it is easy to connect and use their APIs for a small company or a startup without a significant number of transactions.

Thanks!"
"['TD, IB, RealizeFI, ETrade, Alpaca all have apis that do this. But a quick Google search will explain the differences of the brokerages and their sdks, etc.', 'To adding snaptrade to that list as well. The api supports stocks and crypto.', ""I'll add apex to the list.  Also rithmic.  I'm also looking for a solution here too, preferably one not tied to a specific broker or custodian."", 'DriveWealth', 'https://www.realizefi.com letâ€™s you trade from most major brokerages in the US', ""Hello there!
