"Hi r/fintech community. My name is J, and I am the CEO and Founder of a Fintech called Ampli-fi. I have been digging in over at RPAN and noticed that there was no public access channel for business. 

I was interested to start a channel for startups, entrepreneurs, just start & Fintech conversations. 

Musicians are doing a great job of promoting themselves over there and so why not ourselves and our businesses? 

To do this though, we would need more business, motivational, accountability content providers? 

Whose with me?!?! Let's do this.  Please comment so we can see as a community if there is or is not support for a business/entrepreneurship, startup, Fintech, motivational, accountability channel?"
