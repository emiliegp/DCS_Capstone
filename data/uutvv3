"Hi All,

Not sure if I am on the correct sub to ask this question but I have been struggling to decide on which of the two courses to pursue if I want a career in Fintech or Data analyst. Any advise or tips will be greatly appreciated.  


For background, I dont hold any degree but I have a certifcate in computer and IT networks so I consider myself a techy person but with no professional experience. I also hold a certifacte in business accounting and have worked in a medium size company's finance department as an admin and currently working in one of the big 4 accounting firm as an audit support staff. I received a job offer to work as a KYC analyst for one of the top global investment bank (will be based in europe). I am also in my early 30s and one of those who wasn't fortunate enough to afford to go to a uni.

I really want to pursue a career in Finance Analytics or in Fintech but I'm not sure which of the two courses will suit me more and will help me the most to advance in my career. I would also like to note that if I get fortunate enough to complete either of the two that I will be eyeing in completing a MSC in Fintech which the same college offers.

First one is **Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics**  
Core Modules:

Statistics I

Programming for Data Analytics

Statistics II

Second course is: **Higher Diploma in Science in Fintech**

e-Contracts and Payments
