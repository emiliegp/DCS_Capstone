How do fintech startups open banking credit score work?

"There are some startups that are building their own credit scores that do not rely on a credit bureau. One of them that comes to my mind is Credit Kudos.

How do they work and how can they insure their results are really accurate?

For example, suppose the user has two accounts; one is with good credit score the other terrible. If the user only links the account with the good credit score, wouldn't this ""hack"" and provide wrong results?"
"[""I lead a tech and product team at a fintech firm. IMO there are multiple ways to handle this.\n\n1. Not using credit bureau is a no, because you won't be able to get all the running loans. Bank statements are not a very good signal in this case.\n\n2. If you sourcing the customer using an app, you can use SMS to design a transaction log. Even if the customer is having multiple bank accounts, it's highly likely that it's connected to one mobile number.\n\n3. Penetration of account aggregator is pretty low and limited to only 5-6 banks. So bank statements are a way to go currently and if the customer belongs to salaried class, bank statements would not be very complex."", ""I do have an exact answer to it but there is an interesting concept of 'Account Aggregator' in India that is working on this solving this problem. I attempted to a somewhat similar question and maybe it might help. Hence, I am posting link for it below.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/sckjnd/comment/hu7fxq8/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/sckjnd/comment/hu7fxq8/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"", ""I beg to differ here, this is true only for new bank accounts and still not mandatory. For older bank accounts you will have to do reKYC which most customers don't do it. 33 percent of aadhar mandates are rejected at our company due to non linkage."", 'In Europe, the entity would likely require an AISP license form their market regulator. That will enable them to build a banking product that can link to consumer bank accounts for data share and account aggregation services, therefore obtaining the data to build a credit score system.', ""Thanks for the reply.\n\nIn regards to 1. Yes credit bureau is a potential solution but would make it complex to scale. That's the main drawback, you would need to rely on a government credit burea and be limited with a market. And what Innovation would fintechs be providing since the score is retrieved from the credit bureau?\n\n2. it's a good method but I think is only limited by Android. If I stand correct, the application cannot read SMS on IOS.\n\nFor 3. It is one way but would need to ensure that the user already linked all his bank accounts. I don't think there's a tpp account aggregator that will give data of a user who didn't link his account without consent. (It's unethical nonetheless)\n\nWhat do you think?"", ""It's a bit different imo.\n\nThe thing with Account Aggregator is that if you don't provide them access to all your bank accounts, they won't be able to provide accurate results. (Again same point in the post)\n\n\nWith open banking or without, my main question is how can credit score companies be able to provide an accurate result? Currently, the way I see it, is the model can be easily fooled, so my question is what I'm missing or how they're actually doing it?"", ""1. In regards to one it won't be complex to scale because all bureaus are private and are built for scale (though tech is a bit outdated)\n\n2. Bureaus data is just for filtering, fintechs can provide innovation using alternate data like GST, ITR, balance sheet etc and that is a motable product.\n\n3. On SMS bit you are correct but here me out most people using iPhone will probably have internet banking so they can provide bank statement using yodlee or perfios. Major TAM in India is Android based. In totality it doesn't solve the problem but this IMO solves most of it.\n\n4. AA works like UPI, if you don't have one you can create it on the go using various vendors available in the market. But without consent even these vendors cannot excess your data, because these vendors come under NBFC-AA license category and regulated so they wouldn't risk it.\n\nAll in all consent part can be solved using user experience. From my personal experience users care about 3 things:\n1. Instant gratification.\n2. Transperant communication.\n3. Good after service.\n\nAll of the above seem to be easy in theory but can become a barrier to entry for most startups."", 'All bank accounts are linked to a unique identity called Aadhaar Card - you cannot open a bank account without that. In one way, this Account Aggregator simply asks for userâ€™s consent for access to this ID. So that would mean data from each and every financial entity of the user is extracted.', 'Thank you for the insightful comment.\n\nIm regards to one your correct but my main concern is how willing would credit bureas be to work with small startups?\n\nFor the rest, you answered my questions, thank you!!', 'They work for money ðŸ¤‘', ""Haha correct! And that's why mainly I'm not a fan of this. \n\nThe cost of working with a credit burea would make things x5 on the user, while if you provide an estimate using AA, it would be much cheaper.\n\nWe currently have our credit score algorithm, but it relies on user providing access to bank accounts. If they do not link all their bank accounts into the app, we won't be able to provide an accurate estimate. \n\nThat's why I've asked the question in hope of a possible solution.""]"
