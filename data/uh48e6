I’ve been working as a merchant integration/ payment gateway tech analyst for about a year and I find myself at a point where I want to move on from this job. What are some jobs in fintech that would be easy to apply to from my current role? I work for a very large financial services company that most of you are familiar with if I were to disclose what one.
"[""What does a 'merchant integration/ payment gateway' person do?"", 'so you work for plaid?', 'API integration and Merchant account creation, management, and security elevation.', 'No but them and square are our biggest direct competitors.', ""Lil bit plainer please. You build the api's? You create tickets? You PM implementations?"", 'stripe?', 'ooh! Capital One API?', 'Yes I assist with the building of API and the implementation of them into our client’s websites and POS systems. As well as create and manage merchant accounts for our in house automatic payment/billing software.', 'You dev?', 'Very lightly lol this is the extent of it']"
