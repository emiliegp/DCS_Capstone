"['The last 10 years of crypto has basically been a speed run on learning why financial regulations exist', 'As the should be. The vast majority of these fintechs are just ways for banks to skirt regulations put on banks for a reason. Every decade the financial sector blows up the economy, regulators come in to try to fix the mess, the sector then makes up some ""new"" thing to tell the regulators how this new thing isn\'t like the old thing so your regulations don\'t apply, regulators and the judicial system are too slow to process it, make easy profit at the expense of everything else in the mean time, the economy blows up again, rinse and repeat.', 'Of course they do because the regulators have no fuckin clue what is going on with fintech. They mostly think banking should still be an in-person thing and fintech is a website where you can check your balance and maybe pay your bills. \n\nHell, the person in charge of regulating a banks fintech bullshit is called the IT risk person and is in charge of everything from hardware to software to vendors and and fintech partners. And for many banks it’s one person who took a few classes and doesn’t understand crypto any better than they understand rocket surgery.\n\nThey’re still more worried about what a banks call report looked like 6 months ago than what’s happening right now.\n\nSource: me, worked as bank regulator.', 'People are finally figuring out that crypto dark money is funding 2 sides ops / One side incites / Other side causes outrage / same guys funding it gets surveillance contracts.', 'fintechs are banks. all tech is is basically trillions of dollars of shareholder value under a corporate banner which to me seems like... a bank.', 'Wait til they figure out those dumb NFTs are used for money laundering.', 'Be your own bank.', 'This graphic is awful. Is there a spider on that bill or is my phone screen just cracked?', 'Hi! If you are in an expandable fintech business, can I invite you to attend Business Success Conference to get insights on how to scale profitably? The only investment required is your time. Please check out: https://events.eprenz.com/Aa8Q 😊', 'I don’t think a thousand fake competitors are a worry. What would worry the world is currency that can’t be taxed.', 'Regulation is the death of freedom in innovation.', 'The government obviously will try to slowly break it. That’s what governments do.', 'The *entirety* of crypto has a market cap lower than Apple.  Banks skirting regulations is the real issue.', ""The bigger problem is. What's going on in crypto is nothing compared to what goes on on Wall Street. And that goes all the way up to the highest levels, people like Janet Yellen taking over 6 million from banking and investment firms for Zoom calls. And that's not even considered to be even be corrupt any longer, just how they operate openly.\n\nhttps://www.cnn.com/2021/01/04/investing/janet-yellen-wall-street-speeches/index.html"", 'Its why central banks exist, to print free money for bailouts so that financial insitutions dont need risk management.\n\nTheyd go out of business otherwise, like Celcius will. Which is the entire point of crypto.\n\nIf someone wants a crypto bank with no risk they can pay for storage, where the coins arent loaned out like in fractional reserve banking.', 'Are you talking about “fintechs” or something else like crypto founders? \n\nI work for a fintech that makes cloud software for financial institutions. 3 of the top 5 banks in the U.S. use our software. We don’t hold money or crypto or anything that banks do. We make “financial technology” which is what fintech stands for - stuff like loan origination and software for retail bankers.', 'They need a bank charter to be a bank which requires rigorous regulatory review and compliance. So they are not banks.', 'For many Fintech startups the point was to cut out the banks', ""That's what my mattress is for"", '[deleted]', 'If you’re trying to innovate new ways to exploit people, sure.', ""All them pesky patents protecting inventions so they're actually worth investing in because the inventor can be assured of having a chance to get their money back before someone rips off their work.\n\nI mean yeah there's issues in every area, but such a blanket statement as yours is nonsense."", 'freedom is the death of innovation in regulation', 'Banks *manufacturing* the regulations is the real issue. They allow the regulations that make it look like they’re being safe, but aren’t too expensive, to pass. They lobby against and shut down all possibilities of passing the laws that would hit their bottom line too much, or impact their ability to extract revenue from anyone outside of the 0.01%. \n\nThe regulations aren’t there to protect your average consumer from the big banks, they’re there to prevent certain levels of management from exposing the bank to too much risk, while simultaneously making it prohibitively expensive for new banks to form and grow in a way that would threaten the big boys.', '*presses X to doubt*', 'You are definitely correct in your definition, but the term fintech in current layman parlance is usually referring to direct money services, like digital payday lenders, crypto, payment services and BNPL’s. \n\nNot that long ago it used to be more used to refer to trading / hedge fund related groups.\n\nThese days just about any business utilising technology in some way tries to label itself fintech.  Online mortgage lender? Fintech. BNPL (glorified credit card)? Fintech.', '[deleted]', 'Your objections’ stipulations suggest the possibility.', 'While not in a malicious sense innovation in existing industry is often a means to reduce cost. You might get rid of 200 jobs at a factory but have 8 highly paid positions. Unfortunately that’s just good business. Regulation is just a hurdle for new companies as existing ones would have identified incoming hurdles and adapted accordingly, much like google and tech firms pushing around employees trying to minimize perks. I’d bet that vesting schedules for employees played a huge portion in that.', 'Exactly. Regulatory capture is one of the real problems our society faces. Foxes are guarding the hen house…', 'That was why it was created, thats what a lender of last resort is.  The theory is the moral hazard is better than the consequence; and instead of writing laws to prevent too much risk, like Glass Steagal, they just bail everyone out with public money.\n\n>Moral hazard has been an explicit concern in the context of the lender of last resort since the days of Thornton. It is argued, for example, that the existence of a LOLR facility leads to excessive risk-taking by both bankers and investors, which would be dampened if illiquid banks were allowed to fail. Therefore, the LOLR can alleviate current panics in exchange for increasing the likelihood of future panics by risk-taking induced by moral hazard\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lender_of_last_resort', 'Not true. Fintechs cannot do the same things banks can do, which is why they partner with banks. They are not banks.\n\nFor example, fintechs cannot take deposits without a bank charter. SoFi is a Fintech with a bank charter, but it is a rigorous process to obtain one and not worth it for most fintechs, so they partner with banks.', '[deleted]', 'Render to Caesar Caesar’s, taken to the extreme, uncovers freedom †']"
