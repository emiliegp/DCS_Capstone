"For anyone using IDV / KYC / KYC / AML flows as part of your user/customer onboarding, who is usually the person responsible for it in your team? Someone in compliance? PM? Founder?

Also, if you're a small startup, where do you go get more info / educate yourself around the topic to check whether you're getting the right information and the system is implemented correctly (in accordance to AML/KYC requirements)?"
"['Heyo! AML/KYC person here from a FinTech startup, here. We have a 15-20 person Trust and Safety Team broken into Financial Crimes (AML/Fraud/Risk) and KYC (Onboarding/EDD/CDD). KYC handles onboarding with help from the data team. Data builds the tools, KYC then uses the tools and collects data on if/how those tools are functioning properly and constantly monitor for changes with help from EDD/CDD. \n\nHope this helps!']"
