Shared Bank Account with Sub-Accounts (pockets/spaces) in Germany/Europe
2022-09-11 03:21:35
"Hi,

I'm looking for a (neo)bank/fintech offering a bank account for my wife and me which also offers (5-10) Sub-Accounts for budgeting (commonly called pockets or spaces).

The bank/fintech should operate in Germany (where I live) and should have modest fees. 

The companies I know offering Sub-Accounts for budgeting are N26, tomorrowBank or VividMoney. However, all of them do not really offer a shared bank account (in which all owners jointly own the money) but only ""shared spaces"", meaning a second person (or more) can access certain Sub-Accounts of one person's account (which is the owner of the account and money). This does not fully serve my needs.

Does anyone know an alternative?

Thanks a lot."
