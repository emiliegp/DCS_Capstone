"I have a fintech solution and I would like to create multiple payment methods in addition to Card Payments.  If a customer wants to pay, they should be able to see other payment options e.g  Paypal, bank, etc.

My query is specifically on -Paypal: Can I have a setup where collect payments on behalf of various merchants.  If I'm able to collect well and settle in local currency that will be great. So the merchant gets a single API  to multiple payment methods.

Thanks."
