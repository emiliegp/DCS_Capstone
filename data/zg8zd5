"Unlike tradition banking system where routing number almost can be life long and hardly never changed. 

Fintech products such as paypal, cash app also offering free acct and routing number, but they change it every once a while and they do not let you know in advance.

What is the purposes here? To prevent people using their product?"
"['Pure speculation but could be that they aren’t chartered and occasionally switch banking partners and therefore routing numbers…?', 'The fintech industry has evolved/shifted/transformed into a focus on specializing in one aspect of the banking/lending process, and white labeling that service, leading to the moat for fintech becoming smaller (i.e. easier to launch a new neobank/fintech lender). \n\nWe now have a bunch of specialized fintech companies focused on niche markets chasing too little market share, with a strong focus on UI/UX, with much of the technical infrastructure being outsourced. I believe we are now starting to enter a consolidation phase.', 'This.']"
