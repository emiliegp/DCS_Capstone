2022-03-07 20:57:30
"Good morning everyone, I was wondering if someone knows any disruptive fintechs that will have internship positions for summer 2022.

I am a Masters in Finance student, and am based in Europe, but I am open to work anywhere in the world. My main language is English, followed by Portuguese, and a bit of Russian.

I also have some coding experience with python and R, and of course am familiar with financial markets concepts.

I am very enthusiastic about financial innovation which is why I want to play a role in this area.

Don't hesitate to leave a comment, or DM me!

Thank you in advanced!"
