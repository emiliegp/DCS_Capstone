"['Fintech is crazy rn.\nDotcom in 1996?', 'Crazy amount, given it’s slightly bigger than all FinTechs raised last week.', 'I can speak about the scenario in India. Indian credit industry is way way nascent compared to west. Very few percentage use a credit card and traditional banks have very complex criteria and are their tech is not so good. So fintechs are using their tech and repackaging various credit instruments like credit likes as fancy cards to cater to the underbaked and youth. Most of them offer huge discounts across many merchants. Lending and credit is offered by almost all fintechs in India. And of course the amount of cash burn is unprecedented owing to the low MDR (to on-board merchants), huge discounts to consumers. And of course the default risk is way too high considering how they roll out credit to first timers and young population. I really don’t know what is the end game here. If these first timers become sophisticated customers in the future they would simply shift to premium cards and/or banks like Amex. If they do not manage to become better users, they would default.', '?? $130B was invested in Fintech last year.', 'Interesting point. Thanks for sharing!', '[deleted]', 'Indeed. I think we will see bigger numbers this year.', 'Happy to share.', 'I see a ticking time bomb for most of them. But a top few might just be able to make it big.']"
