"Can someone please advise on how [fintech startups](http://dashdevs.com/blog/ways-to-secure-funding-for-a-fintech-startup-1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=article) are valued? What makes lots of them reach such high valuations in a short period of time? Even higher than big companies that have been on the market for decades? 

Thanks a lot for your help!"
"['Hey there are many parameters to evaluate a startup such as their long term vision, products offered and differentiation also market penetration of competitors are taken into consideration while doing that !']"
