Question about Wise
2022-01-28 13:31:03
"HI, i have a question about how wise works. I know when a user wants to send money internationally through wise. wise will use its nostro account in the correspondent bank to transfer the money to beneficiary bank.

It seems pretty simple, however, why does it take sometimes up to 3 days to send money from one country to another(e.g euro to morocco)? Is it because they have to go through AML process strictly for some countries or because they must find someone in morocco who wants to convert morocco currency to euro for mid-market rate?

Why can't they just transfer the money from their nostro account to beneficiary bank? i think in this way it wouldn't take 3days but rather can be done in minutes.

Sorry if i know something wrong here and thank you for your answer in advance"
"['To be fair, Wise takes seconds or “immediately“ to transfer between some currencies (USD, CAD, EURO, AUD, GBP). A couple of years ago it took much longer than seconds to go from USD to INR as you’re suggesting EUR to Morocco, … I suspect the delay is banking requirements in some countries.', 'Yea i think the currency conversion process of Wise would happen immediately nowadays because they can find mid market rate for each transactions a lot quicker thanks to the wide range of user bases and high number of users using the service.\n\nBut still sending money to some countries  specifically to countries in africa, seems to  take a lot more time than it should be. And you said it might be due to the banking requirements here so i wonder what kind of requirements could make the transacrion delay..', 'Remember, Wise’s model doesn’t actually transfer money from one country to another: it puts your Euros into its Euro bucket and gives you Moroccan currency/dirhams from its dirham bucket. I suspect any delay is Morocco-specific bureaucracy with person to person transfers?', 'That makes sense, thanks for your idea!']"
