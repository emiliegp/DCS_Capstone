"Would anyone care suggest any private equity firms that would have some appetite for a Fintech roll up play??

I've got a bead on a way to do a few X on top line all the while getting the traditional economies of scale in distribution and operations.

I know a few players but want to take a fresh perspective."
"['How much capital are you thinking?', 'If u are considering investment options in Fintech companies, u can just buy shares. As a company, which knows in Fintech insustry, we can say, that this trend has a future.', ""Good question.\n\nUltimately, it's pretty flexible.\n\nWe could prove it in with something in the low eight figures, and if I can deliver in accord with expectations, I'd imagine the LPs would be have appetite for more. The strategy capacity is large, probably 10 or 11 figures.""]"
