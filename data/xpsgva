How do banks afford Cashback on Debit cards?

"Hi all, new to the Subreddit. Might sound like a silly question but I know how banks afford cash back on Credit cards through giving customers a percentage of the fees earned by charging retailers but how does cash back work for debit cards?

Does the bank have infrastructure else where, where it allows them to use the extra cash to afford the cash back on debit cards? Can a bank only offering debit cards afford cashbacks?"
"['There are 2 models they use. 1) Sharing a part of their so-called interchange revenue with the cardholder (rates vary by country and type of card, you can find the exact percentages on MC and Visa websites) - these are easier to launch, work regardless of the merchant, but are generally lower. 2) Entering into partnerships with merchants (e.g. specific retailers) which essentially work like affiliate programs with discounts for the cardholder - these require some work and scale, but allow for higher cashbacks. Hope that helps, else hook me up', ""Debit cards also earn interchange like credit cards, but typically at a lower rate. usually 0.75 - 1%. Many of these dumb debit card programs make up the difference in other fees and subscription costs.   \n\n\nNeo-banks don't make money and most will crash and burn."", 'How does the second type work? Do they invoice the partner with the amount or does the partner discounts and then invoice the bank?', 'Both models work. The difference mostly comes from whether the end customer is supposed to perceive this as an immediate discount, or whether as something they ""earn"" and can only cash in later']"
