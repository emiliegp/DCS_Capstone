Setting Up a Joint bank Account with My Partner - Advice Welcome! (US)
2022-03-25 10:36:13
"I am moving in with my partner sometime over the next month or so. We both have separate bank accounts, and I’d like to transition into a ‘smarter’ banking alternative. I follow all things fintech, am up to date with all the big moves being made in the industry, but have no idea how to actually choose and set up a good account for the both of us. 

(On mobile, sorry for formatting)

A few things to note…
1. I use Wells Fargo, my partner uses Citadel.
2. The idea would be to initially use this account as our one source for all big financials (rent, insurance, trips, etc) that we can both connect to, and possibly transition this into a permanent account (for me at least)
3. I meticulously plan my expenses (in excel) and am currently experimenting with Cleo, and really want to dive all into the fintech world with this project

And a few quick questions…
1. How possible is this?
2. Have you done something similar? If so, what was it like?

If there is anything else I should be thinking about when setting this up, please let me know! I listen to podcasts like Fintech Insider weekly, and follow a few news subscriptions, but I haven’t actually done anything with my finances outside of Cleo so any and all advice is more than welcome."
['Best option: Revolut. It has shared pockets feature. Each account is independent from each other but one can create a shared subaccount which can be used by one or two both to contribute and withdraw from.']
