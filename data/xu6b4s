"Like something serious within finance, not just an app that helps with budgeting or something like that. From what I hear, anything that's related to finance is difficult and requires lots of connections to get going. 

Is that right? I like finance a lot, I also want to start a business and it would be ideal to start a finance related business of some sort."
"['It really depends on what your trying to do. I would say no it’s not hard to get going if you have some money', 'There’s a lot of compliance stuff you have to do. For banking for instance, you need like 20 million dollars just as a cushion, not even to spend on anything for the business, it’s a legal requirement. It can definitely be tough, but if you’re doing something that’s good that you believe it it’s worth. Not to mention, it could be lucrative too. \n\nI’m not yet in FinTech, but I’ve looked into all the requirements for starting one. Having connections seems like a definite must', 'There are a ton of Banking as a service infrastructure players that have popped up that handle a majority of the regulatory/compliance challenges. Essentially you create a better UI/UX and brand as a differentiator. It’s doable but what I’d recommend is spending your time focused on finding a problem to solve', ""I don't exactly know yet. But I know a lot of things involving markets and banking are heavily regulated and require that you have connections to get you through those barriers. \n\nWhat I'd like to know is generally speaking when is this the case?"", 'Fintech is just so vague. It could mean lending,investing,payment processing or money transmission, etc. All of them are complex and have regulation but you can still get started. You will have to go out and find those “connections” but it’s doable']"
