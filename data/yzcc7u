"Hello , 
My wife is in accounting field,  5 years of experience and she is thinking to change profession. She has degree in finance. With our preliminary search she needs to learn Python Language. We are settled in Canada , Toronto area. What are  options she should explore ? Which course is better ? Are there any recruiters who help to find Job after course completion. I know it's very common in IT field where recruiters are helping to prepare resume and find job. They also help  for job duties during 1st year if someone's education background is not core IT. Ofcourse they will take cut from your salary for those services. Any similar agencies that helps to train candidates and find jobs in Fintech. Please advise. 
Thank you !"
