"I’m newer to the space and trying to learn and will be in Vegas when Money 20/20 is going on. I’d thought of attending to try and learn, but also found the $3200 price tag pretty shocking. Is it worth it?"
"['If you are in b2b sales or are looking for vendors then its a good place.', 'Sales and networking are popping there. The agenda on the other hand is more or less marketing of the participants (no value there for the audience). \n\nSo, if you are in expansion mode, totally worth it', 'Depends on the stage of your business. \n\nYou need to look at it from an ROI perspective. If you invest $3,200 are you going to make that money + more back within 6 months? If note, you need to focus more on what’s going to grown your business. \n\nFor the bigger brands, this is typically a PR initiative and forms part of their strategy on being present. That in its self is critical to their sustainability.', ""Go if your company is paying for it and roi is free. E.g. It costs you nothing personally and your commission is at least 10k from deals signed.\n\nIf you're not selling to anyone do same inverse. Who can I buy from that will save me 10k. E.g. New PSP, embedded finance etc.\n\nGood luck my Lil Fintech entrepreneur."", 'There should be a cheaper startup price if I recall \n\nHere early stage startup \n\nhttps://account-us.money2020.com/pass-picker#/', 'New to the realm of fintech this year but from a video production stance (came from fashion tech, bit of a curveball). Been really enjoying building content for the space. This thread is really helpful. I’ve wanted to get involved at more events to learn about the industry, it would be a bonus to get some clients but not sure how companies take creatives being at these events ✌️', 'We are very early - and a lot of this would be more me trying to learn more about the fintech space in person. I’m pivoting from a very different industry and know we’ll be hiring people on the technical side, but I’m trying to learn as much as possible to be able to better speak the language and understand what we’re looking for', 'Thanks for the response. My company is paying for it so no huge risk on my end. And I’m excited to be more in the space and look like a complete fool looking to grow and learn!', 'Thanks for your help with this but we haven’t built a platform yet which seems like we don’t qualify for this rate?', 'A few alarm bells for me. If you are pivoting (which is fine) I am not sure how money 20/20 is going to help. You go to these conferences when you have a strong product market fit and you are looking to get increase sales or enable partnerships. \n\nSecondly, looks like you will benefit from an accelerator programme that is fintech focused. There you can soak up knowledge.', 'Pity you missed fintech_devcon this year. Its a great conference, and smaller and more intimate. Moov puts it on.']"
