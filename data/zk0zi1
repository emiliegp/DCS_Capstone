"Hi guys, could I have your advice regarding the job market in SWE or IT related areas for international students with the CS degree? I am targeting fintech companies or investment banks in algo trading parts as I have eight years of experience in finance. 

I have been fortunately admitted to the MSCS at one of the ivy schools for the Fall 23 to land in a job in the US ultimately. If anyone could advise me, I would highly appreciate it :) Thanks all!"
