Is digital banking only for Millenials and Zoomers? What do you think?

"It's clear that [fintech software development](http://dashdevs.com/blog/betting-on-digital-only-banks-a-worthwhile-venture-or-futile-danger/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=article) is changing in accordance with the shifted users' needs and expectations. Do you see a clear generations' distinction on what the digital bank should look like for different age categories of customers? If no, this article would be of avail!"
"[""It's not but the problem with challenger banks is that they bet big on the idea that if you provide some nice UX and a mobile app everyone will switch banks and make you their #1 bank account. They were dead wrong in this assumption and they continue to be growing small deposits and secondary bank accounts which makes having a bank a difficult proposition. To be a bank you need to do a lot of lending and to do that you need liquidity in the form of deposits: you need to have the #1 bank account & savings not the back up one.\n\nIn my opinion what is much more likely to happen is that over time the services layers that banks offer will be peeled off from banks by digital competitors that are not banks (whether it's lending, FX, investments, stock trading, etc.) to the point where banks will continue to exist and provide the physical money infrastructure and will become more service organisations than product organisations (similar to the hardware / software divide). In this future, if it materialises, being a challenger bank serves no purpose, it's much better to attack a niche service, win the market and expand into other services without trying to compete with the bank on deposit infrastructure where you will always lose."", 'No.\n\n-A Gen-Xer', '[removed]', 'You donâ€™t need deposits if you can sell to the capital markets or other institutions. Then just need a really slick UX and relationships with enough institutions that can buy your volume. But building those relationships is the hard part.', '>\tover time the services layers that banks offer will be peeled off from banks\n\nOver time? This is already happening with banking as a service.', "">it's much better to attack a niche service, win the market and expand into other service\n\nBut isn't the ordinary route the majority of digital banks rely on? They usually start with one major function and then broaden their functionality. So, I don't get you to the full here. Can you explain your point on this please?"", '>\\-A Gen-Xer\n\nCan you specify your answer for a bit please? ;)', ""I don't mind your leaving a promo like here, but please stick to our discussion and leave your opinion on the topic as well!"", 'Yep, sounds familiar to [Dashdevs](http://dashdevs.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=main+page). Any advice how to succeed in this tough task?', ""It is but the players so far are largely insignificant in size relative to the big banks. Don't disagree with you on direction of travel though!"", 'True! Do you have particular examples in your mind while thinking about this sort of cleaning?', 'Very simply, there are common online banking needs such as accessing your balance, making transfers, scheduling payments, etc which will always be the most popular things that everyone uses regardless of generation.\n\nIf you are talking about some kind of ""cutting edge"" products such as sending money, sweeping pennies from purchases (up to the next whole dollar) into the savings account or linked investment account and providing direct deposit one or two days early, etc -- again, I propose that every generation could appreciate these features.\n\nRemember that I am Gen X. For the middle class of my age cohort in the US, computers were a common part of our lives from age 12 onwards. For the most part, apps are a part of our everyday lives now also. Many of us use an app for investing, possibly even RobinHood, and we are either aware of or involved in cryptocurrencies.\n\nFor Boomers, I agree it\'s a different story.\n\nIf you are a marketing professional and you insist that there must be strict market segments between the generations, nothing I could say here will convince you anyway. Otherwise, I could certainly see the messaging and possibly the UI theming options for one bank/app being differentiated from another bank/app based on targeted age segment -- even though both apps might have essentially the same banking features. Then we are talking about sending messaging (ads) to different media channels in order to entice the targeted generation to the particular app.\n\n[edits: added content to clarify context in some of my points]', ""Wow! So detailed answer under the previous shortening ;) Now I've got what you mean. Thanks!""]"
