"[Paradigm](https://www.linkedin.com/company/paradigmco/) and [Coatue Management](https://www.linkedin.com/company/coatue-management/) led a $300 million investment that cements NFT marketplace OpenSea as one of the most valuable private firms in crypto.  


OpenSea said Tuesday night that investors valued the company at $13.3 billion in the Series C funding round, up sharply from the startup’s $1.5 billion valuation in a $100 million Series B announced last July. The [The New York Times](https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-new-york-times/) was the first to report the news.  


Tuesday’s big numbers show the rapidity with which OpenSea has ensconced itself as the leading venue for trading non-fungible tokens. The firm said in a blog post it plans to use the funding for product development, hiring, startup investments and to “significantly improve customer support and customer safety.”  


Despite some high-profile user blunders, business has been brisk for OpenSea. In the last 30 days alone, the marketplace for prized profile pics and other digital collectibles logged 1.6 million Ethereum transactions and a trading volume of $2.4 billion, according to data compiled by DappRadar.  


The company was founded by [Devin Finzer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAANPP-kB-PUA-y4WHt_ocPEym35tgaQCkMc) and [Alex Atallah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAWhZYgBBqQD8G9l8-F24j3tHQi6yB1lWBU) in 2017, well before NFTs had captured mainstream interest. CoinDesk’s first piece on OpenSea – for a $2 million funding round led by crypto VC firm 1confirmation – called it “an Ebay for CryptoKitties.”  


OpenSea’s latest round is another sign of the boom times in crypto venture capital, with over $30 billion in investments flowing into crypto startups in 2021."
