Which banks do you hold e-money in. Can you automatically payout from this account. Do you have any idea for pounds (GBP) instead of USD?
"['Follow up question, whatâ€™s your mothers maiden name', ""I'm not sure what you mean by emoney. But wise allows you to hold currency in different wallets. GBP, USD, euro, etc.\nThey issue debit cards. You get swift/routing info for ACH debits."", 'Try Airwallex. Is a multi currency wallet. Is that what you are looking for?', ""If I'm understanding correctly, there's a bunch of companies that do what you're talking about (creating a multi-currency wallet that can send and receive money): Trolley, Wise, Airwallex, Rapyd, Nium, etc.\n\nMost will let you create and administer multi-currency wallets on behalf of others as well, if you're looking to create a product where your customers each have their own wallet(s).\n\nMake sure to check out the KYC/KYB requirements, the SaaS fees, monthly minimums, forex rates, base cost per payment, and which countries they service (in total), and for countries you're interested in whether they're served via wire or local rails (local rails is always cheaper)."", 'If you mean traditional electronic payments ingressed as part of regular operations, generally its fine to just setup one or more additional accounts with the bank you already have your operational account with. \n\nUsually you\'ll want to name this something along the lines of ""deposit account"", ""income account"" or ""echeck account"". \n\nThe proccessors will usually make the deposits in the currency desired. You will not want to payout directly from these accounts, not to vendors nor employees as a matter of internal controls.', 'Is eMoney to eHarmony what Robux is to Roblox?']"
