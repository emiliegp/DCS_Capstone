"How Nubank founder solved Brazil’s banking problem, creating the world’s biggest online bank"

"Nubank has over 48 million customers, making it the world’s biggest online bank by customers. The bank is worth over $40 billion after recently going public. 

After only 8 short years, Nubank has totally disrupted the Latin American banking market. The massive traditional banks that Nubank was competing with are now trying to get a share of Nubank’s online banking market.

**Nubank startup story**

Nubank was started by Colombian David Vélez after he moved to São Paulo, Brazil. Vélez identified the need for a convenient banking service in Brazil, where half of the population was unbanked despite being the world’s seventh-largest economy. Back then, there were about 5 banks in the whole country. All of them charged a huge fee with high-interest rates on credit cards and had terrible customer service. 

Velez’s frustrating experience with trying to open a bank account in 2013 inspired this idea. After spending nearly an hour waiting at the bank to begin the process, it took an arduous 4-months before it was complete. Velez knew that no matter where he went in Latin America, the process would be the same.

So, he decided to solve the problem all on his own using technology. And so, Nubank was born as an independent, digital bank to help the people of Brazil become more financially savvy. 

**Nubank Launch**

In 2014, Nubank entered the banking sector with their Mastercard-backed credit card linked to their customers’ smartphones. This idea was unlike anything the people in Brazil had ever seen before from traditional banks, and so Nubank grabbed their attention. 

About 200,000 people put their names on the Nubank waiting list within the first year, with 100,000 people successfully onboarded. 

**Nubank Customers and Growth**

In 2016 - just two years after their official launch - Nubank hit 1 million accepted credit card customers. This was almost entirely through word of mouth and referrals. 

And with the kind of success that the Neobank had experienced, in 2017, Nubank received a Brazilian banking license. This allowed the platform to offer checking and savings accounts, which automatically increased their user base. 

Within five months, about 1.5 million of Nubank’s credit card customers had signed up for bank accounts and traditional financial services.

Today, Nubank’s overall user base is sitting at 48.1 million. This makes Nubank the largest digital bank in the world by the number of its customers.

**How Much is Nubank Worth?**

 Currently, Nubank has a valuation of $41.5 billion after making its Wall Street debut.

**Summary**

In 8 short years, Nubank has become the biggest Fintech bank in Latin America. The company went from an idea born out of Velez’s frustration with Brazil’s outdated banking system to launching its free, app-linked credit card and obtaining a banking license to offer a broader range of financial services.

In the process of disrupting Latin America’s banking sector, the company has made banking accessible to millions of people and built the world’s largest digital bank. Thanks to a unique business model and idea, financial services in Brazil will never be the same again.
