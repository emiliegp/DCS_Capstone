"[""This was an egregious example of repeat violations from a startup, but I expect the first of many salvos from a much more aggressive CFPB. Quoting from the article:\n\n* **Deceived consumers about the benefits of repeat borrowing**: LendUp misrepresented the benefits of repeatedly borrowing from the company by advertising that borrowers who climbed the LendUp Ladder would gain access to larger loans at lower rates when, in fact, that was not true for tens of thousands of consumers.\n* **Violated the CFPB’s 2016 order**: The CFPB’s 2016 order prohibits LendUp from misrepresenting the benefits of borrowing from the company. LendUp’s continued misrepresentations about the LendUp Ladder violate this order.\n* **Failed to provide timely and accurate adverse-action notices required by fair lending laws**: Adverse-action notices inform consumers why they were denied credit. Timely and accurate notices are vital to maintain a transparent underwriting process and protect consumers against credit discrimination. LendUp failed to provide adverse-action notices within the 30 days required by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) for over 7,400 loan applicants. LendUp also issued over 71,800 adverse-action notices that failed to accurately describe the main reasons why LendUp denied the applications as required by ECOA and Regulation B.\n\nNote that LendUp wasn't small - $2B loans across 6.5 million customers. They're now shutdown.\n\nI expect this to be the first of many such actions, not all of which many result in a full shutdown of operations. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra has already come out vocally against overdraft fees and other activities view to be discriminatory or predatory. He's setting groundwork for a different agenda than we've seen the previous four years.\n\nThe highly successful Silicon Valley fintech funding model has been growth at all costs. That's worked well in an accommodating regulatory environment without a recession. Attention is now being broadened from just the banks and we will experience a recession at some point (note: not a prediction of when, simply a statement that we haven't graduated from recessions).\n\nI'll be keeping on eye on how the regulatory stance evolves and how that may affect funding models."", 'This is a fantastic write up. I’m in Australia and have heard of the CFSB two times in the past week, your post makes a third. I love to see them going after Buy Now Pay Later firms, personally. \n\nIf you’ll permit me to ask a dumb question - is this brought about by a change in the leadership of the regulator or something?', 'Thanks for the writeup! I was the compliance manager handling aspects of this issue and others.', ""You nailed it.\n\nCFPB is Consumer Financial Protection Board. Formed in the wake of 2008. Responsible for, unsurprisingly, consumer protection. Stuff like credit card fees, overdraft fees, and consumer disclosures. Broad mandate that at times steps on the toes of other regulators.\n\nIt was the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren (Democrat) and created under Obama as part of Dodd-Frank legislation. Neutered during the Trump (Republican) administration, it's expanding presence again under Biden (Democrat). Seeing a more active role today under Director Rohit Chopra.  \n\n\nChopra made headlines recently about overdraft fees as well."", ""That's fascinating! I've worked with financial firms as they worked to get out from under MRAs, but I've never been on the other side of the table. I'm very curious.\n\nWhat was the cadence and conversations with the CFPB? How was that then translated across LendUp in an attempt to resolve the issues?\n\n(For completeness - A Matter Requiring Attention, or MRA, is the vernacular by which bank examiners communicate criticisms to a bank’s management or (increasingly) the board of directors.)"", 'Awesome. I have followed you on Reddit and will do on your website too for further updates. Thank you for the post, a lot in this sub seem to be pretty crap but the intersection of regulation and innovation is fascinating and important (to me, at least).', ""Thanks! And likewise. I've lived and built at that intersection for many years. I continue to find it fruitful.""]"
