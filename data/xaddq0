This is the first #fintech I know of thatâ€™s had to close its door due to the market & rate environment. Am I missing any others? Any predictions on the next shoe to drop?
"[""I wouldn't say that Commonbond has to wind down due to the market and rate environment, but rather from the regulatory landscape. If the US government is forcing a moratorium on student loan payments, then there won't really be a demand to refinance those loans. \n\nMost fintech student loan lenders have diversified into other loan types (unsecured personal, credit cards, etc). \n\nCommonbond made an attempt to diversify into solar loans, but wasn't able to do so in time.""]"
