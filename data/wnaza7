"Do you think of fintech as an innovation, the future of money, or a mode of bringing social change?"
"['Fintechs are designed to make money for the owners. Bringing social change is the marketing claim.', 'Synapse is asking these questions now?', 'Fintech is not the future of money. Financial services have existed for a long time. Fintech is simply trying to make financial services better by making it technology enabled.', 'There are examples of it bringing social change already. Mpesa in Africa is a very tangible example.', 'My fintech is designed to bring social change.', ""Every new tech promises social change, which for most people means an alleviatiation of difficulty and inequality. \n\nEvery time our eyes glaze over, and we dont realize what were giving is often more than what were getting. \n\nWhether it was the robber barons of yesteryear, Mark Zuckerberg and now Elon's facade is starting to crack (especially with the HyperLoop revelations) we should probably stop kidding ourselves that entrepeneurs have any interest in anything beyond the exploitation of others for their own personal wealth."", 'Yes, we like to help cultivate discussion and see problems developers are facing when building Fintech systems.', ""What are some of the improvements you've seen in financial services in the last 2 years?""]"
