What are the economics of BNPL? There's a merchant fee involved + a short term consumer loan. Any idea what the total economics are of a BNPL business and how they're broken down?
"['Say customer A bought a $100 jacket , at $25 x 4 installments . The BNPL company pays $94 to Zara and takes the risk of installments on itself. $6 is the profit and rest comes from if the customer A missed any installments and pays high interest > 25% on it . \nWith economies of scale BNPL companies = ðŸ’µ', 'With economies of scale and very solid credit underwriting.']"
