How do customers use WeChat Pay?

"[Y Combinator](https://www.linkedin.com/company/y-combinator/) has long advised founders to be an avid user of the product and solve their own problems. While WeChat was sitting comfortably at the 300M MAU mark, a simple feature to help their own management team give out Red Packets after Chinese New Year would help them nearly double.  


WeChat Red Packets originates from one of [Tencent](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tencentglobal/)’s company custom and broader Cantonese tradition that every manager in the company gives each employee a red envelope with a small cash gift on the first work day after the Chinese New Year holiday.  


As the company expanded, it became exhausting for some managers to give out so many Red Packets so they asked for technical solution to solve the issue – they had no idea that the result would become the prototype of WeChat Red Packet.  


The first version of WeChat Red Packets was developed by a team of 20 in 3 weeks. It was tested internally on WeChat OA users and was immediately well-received. From New Year’s Eve in 2014 through 4 pm on the day after, over 5M users used WeChat Red Packets.  


WeChat Red Packets today has several different versions, including one with a random cash amount and one with a fixed cash amount – with the random packets, each recipient gets a random fraction of the total amount initially sent by the sender (no more than RMB 200, USD 29 each to avoid bribery).  


This makes receiving a Red Packet in the presence of a group of people like a lottery combined with a fortune cookie – you have no idea how much money you will receive before you open the packet, and getting more than others can be a sign of good luck. This good luck implication also makes it a perfect game among close acquaintances at a party.  


This is another example of the “Group Effect” in practice. Since Red Packets are sent within group chats, the rate of adoption increased as more users received it.  


The substantial growth was observed in 2015 with over 1B Red Packets sent during the Chinese New Year holiday. The growth of WeChat Pay was initially driven by close tight knit social circles - friends and family sending money to each other and they were willing to connect their bank accounts to do the same.  


This important move was necessary to build trust among users and to inculcate the user behavior to drive mobile payments before extending this feature to more shallow circles like paying merchants, online and offline stores. The payment network was boosted even further by a partnership with [DiDi](https://www.linkedin.com/company/didiglobal/) (China’s version of Uber) to facilitate in-app payment for WeChat customers’ Didi rides.  


This partnership opened up a broader universe of payment partners who now work with WeChat enable in-app payments for everything from cell phone bills to utility fees.  


As of 2016, Tencent has 600M mobile payment MAUs and over 600M average daily payment transactions.
