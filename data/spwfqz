Feedback on visualisation tool we've been working on
2022-02-11 21:34:43
"Hey guys,

In the course of building a fintech database we built a network visualization tool (examples at [Fintechmap.ch](https://Fintechmap.ch) and [deeptechnation.ch](https://deeptechnation.ch) .) It's now being picked up by a few larger FS firms to use a [project management tool](https://depot.clarafinds.com/graphs/astoria/)

We've also been working on a transaction monitoring/AML tool:

* [High risk jurisdictions](https://owndbs-pr-28.herokuapp.com/graphs/high-risk-jurisdictions)
* [Recurring originator and beneficiary](https://owndbs-pr-28.herokuapp.com/graphs/recurring-orig-and-ben)
* [Correspondent banking](https://owndbs-pr-28.herokuapp.com/graphs/correspondent-banking)
* [Internal payment](https://owndbs-pr-28.herokuapp.com/graphs/internal-payment)

Obviously we're not yet at PMF, but we're super keen to for some feedback/ to partner with anyone who has ideas on how they could use this! In its essence it visualizes tabular data in a network/graph format."
"['WOW! For starters, your sites are all so beautiful. The first two are really cool, especially the one showing all the Swiss based Fintechs. Just curious what tech stack you guys built this in? My gut tells me RoR?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn addition to the transaction monitoring, I might have some ideas for you. I run a start-up in the US and we are monitoring transactions on the Visa rails for community banks. What if I passed you some anonymized data for testing purposes to see what your tool could do with it? It would be interesting to see relationships with specific accounts and large merchants and brands.', ""Your gut is right RoR and D3 for the visualisation layer.\n\nThat would be great, we'd be keen to see if we can do anything meaningful with it! I'll PM you.""]"
