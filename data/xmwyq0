Looking for a career change
2022-09-25 02:16:29
"Hey folks,
Looking for some advice. I’m trying to change careers and it was suggested to me that fintech might be a good fit.

I’m looking for a career that:
-Can be entered with no experience primarily through attaining certifications (trying to avoid paying for classes if possible)
-Can lead to a full time remote position that pays decently

Would love to hear from some of you that do this for a living if you’re here, especially to know what your average day of work looks like! 

Thanks"
"['FinTech is an industry, not a career. \n\nWithout enough information, no one here will be able to offer any advice. You’re just asking for a higher paying position with no experience that allows you to work from home. Lol', 'Early stage Fintech founder in the equipment finance space. Dm if you want to discuss', 'r/learnprogramming', 'Fintech can be a broad term. It can span over many industries. What i did was searched my specific industry and fintech in indeed. Found a company and now i work for a fintech and do consulting work within the former industry. I did not need classes as my knowledge of the former industry helped push the product/service sold by the fintech.', 'lol!!']"
