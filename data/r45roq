Cyber Security is FinTech's Achille's Heal
2021-11-29 01:42:29
" In more ways than one, 2021 has been a huge year for fintech.  The fintech sector is booming, with a record $91.5 billion in global funding so far this year—that’s almost twice as much as what the sector collected in the entirety of 2020. The past quarter saw the birth of 42 fintech unicorns (startups valued at over $1 billion), bringing the year’s total to 200, according to CB Insights’ State of Venture Q3’21 Report.  From a macro perspective,  in 2021 the global fintech industry is expected to grow by 23.41% and reach $324 billion by 2026. However, with the continuous changes in the fast-paced fintech space, financial service providers are looking for advice on how to stay one step ahead.  One key area where this hot new field is falling seriously behind is in the realm of security, where more often than not companies increasingly sacrifice security for innovation.

One key area where fintech as a whole is behind the curve is in cybersecurity.  As an increasing share of day-to-day interactions are completed within the digital sphere, implementing high-caliber cyber defensive capabilities is an absolute must for the field as a whole. Part of the issue is structural; fintech companies and startups are more lightly regulated than banks due to modest legal regulations. They also offer shorter time-to-market, which is particularly important from the business perspective.   
 However, rapid release cycles means that fintech companies often simplify their products or skip certain features. As a result, fintech companies often secure their solutions only partially, omitting some security measures altogether, especially when they can’t see the added business value.

As fintech takes off, there is another important trend to consider: the alarming rise in both the tempo and sophistication of private-sector cyber attacks (especially ransomeware).  Though specific figures for annual losses due to cyber attacks is elusive,  IMF modelling exercise has estimated that financial institutions’ average annual losses from cyber-attacks could reach “a few hundred billion dollars a year”, eroding their profits and threatening financial stability.  This not not small change for an industry that literally undergirds the global economy.  So whos doing something about it?

First off, there has been an encouraging uptick in G2G/public sector collaboration on this pernicious issue. Just yesterday, the  national Bangladesh Bank announced plans to launch a computer emergency response team for the financial sector (Fin-Cert) to avert cyber attacks.  The Fin-Cert will monitor the banking sector's cyber security situation and provide necessary support and advisories to help prevent probable and imminent cyber attacks. It will also facilitate the exchange of information among all the connected financial institutions.  Also this month in a similar vein, Israel and the US (to global fintech and cybertech leaders)  agreed on establishing a bilateral collaboration to tackle the growing threat of ransomware in fintech. They want to safeguard vital financial infrastructure and emerging technologies as well as expand international cooperation to combat the threat ransomware poses to nations and the world economy.  These are just two recent examples of some of the top-down approaches currently being considered by states worldwide.  On this count, the jury is still out.

Then, there's a number of private sector innovators that are applying military-grade cyber technology to protecting critical infrastructure, finance featuring chiefly therein.   The adoption of new remote-working technologies in the banking and financial services sector is challenging the outside-in security approach. A 2020 IBM survey found that organisations deploy approximately 45 different solutions on average, with most requiring coordination across 19 security tools. One firm rising to the challenge is HUB Security, an Israel-based confidential computing pioneer with its eyes set on NASDAQ.  The company specializes in protecting sensitive commercial information and has an advanced encrypted computing solution for companies and organizations aimed at preventing hostile intrusions and the theft of sensitive commercial information.  They've explicitly named fintech and financial sector as strong candidates for their advanced cyber technology.  Meanwhile, larger industry leaders such as Microsoft Azure, IBM, and Palo Alto Networks are adapting their enterprise security packages to more directly respond to fintech and financial services.  Ideally, public and private sector efforts will continue in tandem until a more secure financial framework is operationalized in coming years.

In sum, the cyber vulnerabilities inherent in much of the fintech space today should be a serious cause for concern.  As blockchain and digital wallet tech continues to upend the way consumers execute transactions and relate to money, the fintech-cyber nexus can be expected to strengthen in coming years.  Preserving that spirit of innovation is key to fintech's future viability and explosiveness, but this need NOT come at the cost of financial insecurity for global consumers."

Secondly, i'm pretty sure I read a while ago that's customer's number one concern as well, so yeah I think you're very much on point."", ""Thanks for raising this important topic with insightful data and facts! It's true that fintech apps are often vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks due to a lack of compliance or security features.
