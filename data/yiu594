Looking for subject areas and business trends

"I am looking for subject areas to look into within FinTech. I currently work for a payments platform company and I am finding the FinTech world very interesting. I have a strong background in mathematics and computer science. I am looking for subject areas within FinTech that are largely math-focused and would lend themselves to programming (possibly hot business trends or cool technology coming up in the FinTech world). Right now, I am working through Kelvin Lancaster's Mathematical Economics. Any help or recommendations is greatly appreciated. I am just looking to be pointed in the right direction. Thanks!"
"['If you like FinTech and you love maths there are two areas to possibly go into: insurance underwriting and digital lending.\n\nI would recommend digital lending as it offers a world of possibilities across the globe once you get into the right circles. Plus a great risk officer is always sought after!\n\nA great way to start is to become a data scientist / risk analyst in a FinTech lending startup.', 'You want to venture into blockchain?', '\\+1 for these recommendations.  Data-driven corporate governance is a hot topic and will grow immensely in the years to come.', 'Awesome! I’ll check it out. Thanks!', 'Sure! I’m open to going into any area at this point.']"
