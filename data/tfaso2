Looking for a capital partner for liquidity
2022-03-16 17:04:51
"hey friends! 

I'm working on building a mortgage company for founders, freelancers and small business owners.  


Current problem I'm running into and wanted to seek help here is the following: Searching for a Non-Delegated Investor who will let me retain servicing on the mortgages.   


I've spoke to multiple lending institutions who have told me their req. for warehouse lines however I need to find a capital partner who is able to purchase the mortgages to provide liquidity so I can continue to use my warehouse lines. I'm looking to service the mortgages myself as well so servicing needs to be retained.   


Kind of a needle in the haystack. I'm calling up everyone and talking to industry partners. Will be attending few conferences in the coming months to network with industry folks.   


Wanted to post this here to see if anyone here may be able to point me in the right direction.

Thank you in advance!"
"[""Well all banks are going to reject that business model unless you got the relevant regulatory permits. Assuming you got your mortgage business licenses from your regulators you typically got three options:\n\n1. Finding an investor (VC -> they typically won't invest unless it is a tech product with good traction, e.g. an online lending platform with a good amount of customers) who'll provide that liquidity for some equity in your company\n2. Work with FIG investment banking groups to securitize these mortgages but that would require huge mortgage volumes (small/mid cap banks requiring mid 8 figures already).\n3. Start as mortgage broker and help your clients get these mortgages from established banks (in that case you can also team up with banking as a service providers / white label banks -> which essentially means they are making the credit decisions not you). This last option will also help you establish a track record for option 1 (some VCs might be willing to skip that part if you have extensive mortgage experience front- to back at a well a well-known lender)."", 'Wow I learn so much hereðŸ˜…, thanks you folks', 'Regulatory piece of the business is under control for the most part. Have already started the conversations with compliance lawyers.   \n\n\nI don\'t think this would be the best use of VC money so I don\'t really expect for a VC to come and buy mortgage assets. I\'ll be pitching angels for the technology/business side for equity.   \n\n\nDidn\'t consider the FIG IB side of things till now but there are also mortgage lenders that buy these assets. It\'s their niche however they usually have terms little bit different from what I\'m looking for. (ex. the want to have the servicing portion of the mortgage). I\'ve also been considering family offices as they may be interested in something like this? Not sure but going to ask around.   \n\n\nAlready doing the broker stuff, Found $7M of leads in the first month of which $5M are on the way to close. The demand for this is already there. Just need to innovate. Setting up a broker shop would be a great small business, nothing wrong with it and could be pretty successful but I\'m taking a shot at innovating and providing a better service. Expecting to hear a lot of ""no\'s"" along the way since what I\'m doing isn\'t as common.   \n\n\nHappy to chat more!']"
