"Redneck bank- confused by its promotional material, kinda weirded out by the donkey face and animated fly on its homepage. Can someone explain their marketing strategy?"

Who are they targeting? why would I sign up if it requires debit card purchases?
"['We all know about this tiny bank so the marketing apparently works.  Only lenders like Rocket figured this out a while ago-  thatâ€™s why all of their banner ads are horrible with blinking lights and crazy graphics.  It attracts eyeballs and clicks', ""It is a marketing wrapper for [All America Bank](http://allamerica.bank/). It must appeal to someone, because I've heard of Redneck a few times."", '""It is a marketing wrapper for All America Bank. It must appeal to someone, because I\'ve heard of Redneck a few times.""\n\nYeah hm... seems like it requires 10 debit card transactions per month or something, looks not quite worth it unless someone just can\'t get a credit card', 'Pretty typical rewards program. They want your interchange naturally.', ""Seems to be a common requirement for high APY checking accounts. Not worth it to me either. Some people use debit cards a lot though or don't have credit, so maybe it makes sense in that case.""]"
