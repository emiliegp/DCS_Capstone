Banking in Korea: why we have got +1000 Koreans with no marketing?

"Hey there! My name is Raman, I'm product manager at ZELF - neobank with fiat money, NFTs and Game Loot under one roof.

We operate +2 years in Europe, but recently launched our product worldwide (with a focus on the US) and I saw an interest from Korean users. But we didn't even made any marketing for the Korean market.

**My hypothesis:** we are attractive thanks to our extra-fast onboarding with no necessary KYC (know your customer procedure). Regular users get their cards in 30sec (of course, with spending limits), and they don't need to show us their IDs / SSNs.

**What do you think?** Any other ideas?

**And the second question I wanna ask:** is it reasonable to advertise in KakaoTalk or Instagram is more effective? Our audience is mostly GenZ (18-25 y.o.) with interests to tech, NFT, metaverses and gaming.

You're welcome to my DM, we grant a bonus for your ZELF account for any valuable information!"
