"Hi! I'm a business student studying ISM (Information system management) and I'm writing a bachelor's thesis starting this week. 

I'm interested in topics regarding fintech and would like to ask for topic suggestions to write my thesis about. For example fintech in supply chain finance, fintech in banking, or maybe something else? I would also much appreciate it if you use your knowledge to suggest a specific problem to make it my title and write my whole thesis about. THANK YOU!!"
"['Legislation is changing the way companies are able to account for their supply chain financing programs (debt). This may disrupt the entire industry. If you choose this as a topic let me know and I can probably help (I work in a parallel industry to SCF).', 'How to on-ramp cryptocurrency from fiat using major credit cards without running afoul of anti money laundering regulations or being coded as high-risk by the card scheme.', ""Maybe you should start following the news about fintech to help you out with the thesis? A good way to start is to follow newsletters.\n\nThis one is good for beginners: [https://fintechwave.substack.com/](https://fintechwave.substack.com/)\n\nThere are lot of fintech related topis, but if we are talking about the bachelor's thesis (it should be anywhere from 30-50 pages long, right?), you need something for whih you can find relevant sources. I would pick a topic that is somewhat connected with banking such as how neobanks differ from standard banks (no offices, all is done online etc)  \n\n\nIn any case, first find relevant sources on banking and from them make a thesis about fintechs/neobanks.""]"
