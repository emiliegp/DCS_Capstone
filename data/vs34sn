I want a career in fintech
2022-07-06 03:22:15
"Hello all,

I’m 21, a college student, and totally lost. I had little to no guidance out of high school and so I decided to just take a couple years worth of general ed credits at a local community college.

Now I’m nearing my Junior year of schooling and I just picked on finance because I want to make decent money and have always been pretty good at math (I know that’s not the most important thing but I thought it might help.) 

I’ve been doing some research on the fintech industry and it definitely interests me. I’d like to work some kind of office job, and I’d love to deal with some sort of financial planning or analysis. I think I would be good at it given proper training or teaching. 

My main problem, or rather the main reason I post this, is that I’m looking for advice on what to do NOW. Sure, I can continue school and pick up a Finance degree, but just having that piece of paper won’t get me to where I want to go.

I currently work at a used car dealer and I kinda hate it. Not due to the job itself, but it’s a 45 minute commute for me now. I really want to find something I can start doing now that is at least related to fintech. I’m just pretty lost- my parents aren’t really of any help and even the career center at my school boiled it down to “make connections”.

I just need help. I wish I would have been more participatory with school and stuff because without club or leadership involvement, I haven’t had any luck with finance internships.

Thanks to everyone for reading or for any advice

TL;DR : I’m a broke 21 year old with no direction. I want to create a career in fintech but I don’t know what to do right now to make it possible in the next couple years."
"['Likely nothing you’ll learn now in school will apply to Fintech by the time you’re finished. It’s an ever changing landscape. I wasn’t very engaged in school clubs either so my advice is start in banking or software sales and work your way up, learn the business as it develops.', 'First of all learn SQL and excel with at least fundaments of VBA. Then you can look on Tableau or power BI. Will be much easier with these skills in CV', 'OK, my age allows me to play your parent role here. :)\n\nWhichever way you choose, focus on *profession*, not industry: what is booming today won\'t necessarily be on demand tomorrow, so you need to be able to switch to a different industry keeping doing relatively the same.\n\nMoreover, with things (e.g., technologies) changing pretty fast these days it\'s **impossible** to predict what this or that industry will look like in 5-10 years. Nobody needs dozens of bookkeepers today, as these operations are mainly handled by software, which you don\'t even have to install - it\'s a SaaS/cloud thing.\n\nThere\'s only one sure way to forecast in volatile environment - concentrate on *eternal* things: ask yourself what is not only needed today, but will also be needed tomorrow and years ahead? 5 fingers will be enough to count these things: **communication** with other human beings (always on demand until the humanity dissappears), **security** (desire to be in safety is an integral part of our nature), **health** (no comment needed, right?), **positive emotions** (same story as with security), etc.\n\nBoiling it down to a concrete decision/profession. Given that technologies change fast (I mentioned that above) there will be a continuing discrepancy/misalignment between them, which in its turn is a room for their malfunction or unauthorized use (attacks). Since you have passion for fintech, I assume you\'re a pretty technical-oriented guy, so STEM and stuff won\'t frighten you. :) So you can go (i.e. study) in the direction of security (e.g., IT systems security), which is on high demand now and will stay to be on demand in future, even when quantum computers come into play, as tehcnologies will change (and it will be your responsibility to follow them in a timely manner), but **demand (!)** will stay in place.\n\nFinally, profession like that will allow you to hop pretty easily between industries, as security in e.g. banks, though has peculiarities of course, is not so much different from that in retail. I\'d say if you have experience in a more regulated, ""tough"" industry, you will *always* be welcomed in other industries with that expertise. So makes sense to take that into account as well.\n\nHope it helps, feel free to drop me a line if need is - will be glad to help in what I know.', ""Your career center isn't wrong about making connections. People are the doorways you have to go through to find opportunities. \n\nMost people you meet are gonna ask you some variation of 'what do you do?', to which you should be answering 'i'm in school pursuing Finance'. Eventually, someone will say something like 'oh, my uncle works at ___' or something like that. If that uncle is at that party, hazzah. Variations on that are what networking is all about. \n\nLook for other jobs at finance companies you want to work for. Get an entry level job and you'll be networking way harder with finance people. \n\n>some sort of financial planning or analysis.\n\nNot very Fin_tech_ honestly. You could look into getting your CPA or something."", 'I currently work in FinTech with MoneyGuide and eMoney - both financial planning platforms. If you are interested in the financial planning or analysis of FinTech as someone above mentioned I would begin working at a bank that has financial advisors, like Chase. That could give you the opportunity to talk with people working with the tools you’re interested in and you could begin to learn more about them. You may be able to get licensed through the bank as well depending on your role (bankers generally get licensed) and that would help you get your foot in the door with some of the planning platforms.', 'Financial analysis, any training in credit analysis that you can get-basically the building blocks of finance-will be incredibly helpful. CFA is solid, too. All of this will remain relevant throughout your career.', 'I think you need to sit down and maybe do a few things \n\nOne upskill like a maniac , fintech colonies are never stable so sometimes you are going to be doing more than your are expecting\n\nIf you haven’t learnt excel, VBA or SQL you are killing your chances\n\nGo and apply for junior accountant roles, accountants means you can easily transition to auditors or at the very most understand where the money is coming in and out of companies , especially fintech that deal with a lot of money.\n\nNext most fintech hire but they most likely hire based on their network of hiring managers\n\nBest bet is to find when they have the internship or summer programs.Could be very helpful \n\nLastly as someone who reads and loves fintech , I want you to understand that if you end up working in a tech company that has a finance department it would not be a disservice to you.\n\nLastly may think more about the roles you want to do when it comes to fintech or financial industry. Cause it’s easy to get swept away \n\nCPA or CFA will boost your chances a lot more\nBut having experience will be even better \n\nHope you discover what you are looking for', 'https://www.awesomefintech.com/\n\nDont let skills become an obstacle to doing what you want to do.  \n\nFind an interesting company in your area.\n\nGet hired because of your persistence and attitude. The rest will work itself out', 'Perhaps you don’t enjoy your current job but if you stick with your current degree you will have more than enough relevant experience to get a job as an SDR at any fintech', 'As a former 21 year old, lemme share some unsolicited advice. It’s okay to be lost. I had no clue what I really wanted till I reached my late 20s.\n\n\nAs other folks here rightfully commented, focus on what you love to do. Not an industry. Finance doesn’t always demand a degree in finance.\n\nFor example, I’m a graduate in a non-finance stream, but I ended up working for a major fintech/bank/lender firm handling their Fraud Risk Department. So nope, you don’t need a grad in finance to get into fintech. Does it help? Yea. But necessary? Not really.\n\n\nTLDR; it’s okay to feel lost. Figure out what you’re truly passionate about (and not just the industry).', 'thanks for your response :) since i’m currently doing car sales i was thinking about doing some kind of software sales next…', 'Thank you for your response. It means a lot. I’ll have to start with learning what those acronyms mean first (haha) then get into picking them up as skills of my own.', 'I agree on this learning SQL will help you so much', 'My fiancé is a car salesman and he does much better than I, financially. But he enjoys sales. If you enjoy sales or are customer experience minded, head on into banking or software, if not- you might enjoy stuff that powers it on the back end, like SQL (as others suggested). SQL, Power BI etc. not a strength or interest of mine but I do sell banking software so some familiarity is required.']"
