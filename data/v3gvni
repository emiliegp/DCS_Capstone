"I understand that I can invoke some APIs to purchase/sell assets but how do handle a case when a user needs to deposit money into the system? Do I need to have an account somewhere to keep his money?

&#x200B;

Then when a user is going to purchase some assets, I assume I invoke some API, e.g. ETrade which would look like this:

buy-asset(my userID, number of shares, ticker)

Do I need to have an account at ETrade for this user with some balance available?"
