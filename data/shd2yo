Payments architecture education course

"Would anybody recommend a course about payment system architecture? The course has to contain technical details about payments service infrastructure, architecture, details about 3ds 1.0 / 2.0, google, apple pay, uptime consistency etc. 

I have encountered lots of courses about ""fintech innovation and payments"", but everything is more general knowledge than tech details. Thank you."

So it is a little bit more complicated :)', 'You’d want to start with familiarizing yourself with PCI DSS regulations. Also SOC 2 and ISO 27001 go along the way usually. \n\nArchitecture itself will depend on what kind of product you’re building and your business approach. \n\nI.e. Adyen and Stripe have similar products but they are built in different ways. \n\nIf I were you I wouldn’t start building a payment processor without at least a 7-figure budget. If you’re doing this for US market, then 8-figure. \n\nRe: 3ds – this will depend on your banking partner. \nAnd I wouldn’t worry about Apple and Google pay before whole infrastructure is done.']"
