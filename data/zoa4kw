Is there a portfolio analytics tool that looks through all my ETF holdings to the company stock-level?

"Hi! I'm curious if there's a tool that I load in all my mutual funds and then see what my ultimate exposure to various stocks are? For instance, I might own AAPL in many different mutual funds across different accounts (401k, IRA, etc), so I would be interested in knowing what % of my portfolio is actually AAPL stock."
