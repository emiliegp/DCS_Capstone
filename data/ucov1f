"For those that have a fintech product, what software do you use with your product?"
"[""\t\nWe don't use anything too unusual - Stripe for payments, Pilot for accounting, Gusto for payroll and benefits, Airtable and Notion.\n\nOnly atypical one is we recently implemented https://passbase.com/ for KYC which work well for us."", 'Whatever it is, use YubiKey with it instead of Google 2fa. Yubikey is much more safe, can be used in any google required 2fa fintech platform and even can require your physical touch to authorize the log-in. \n\nYubikey 5 NFC is what I recommend.', 'I am)', 'idk what Yubikey is but, why is this downvoted?', 'Yubikey is essentially a usb fingerprint reader used for 2-factor authentication. Not sure about the downvoting, though. I’m pretty uneducated when it comes to the merit of yubikey vs Google 2fa or any news about the two', ""Google users. \n\nNotice how they can't rebut \n\nHowever they can downvote...haha this is reddit for you."", ""The sensor is ancillary to the technology. It's an added layer to an already rock solid security device. \n\nThat's why it's fifty dollars a piece."", 'Just a note - it does finger tap not finger print.\n\nThe security is a clever cryptography exchange between the site asking for your ‘second factor’ and the physical Yubikey device.\n\nThe finger tap is so if you leave it plugged into your computer, a bad site or script can’t trigger the key without your awareness and deliberate touch.\n\nThink of it like those car keys that plug in (or some even work if you’re just carrying them) instead of inserting into a lock that turns.  Once plugged in, you just ‘press to start’.']"
