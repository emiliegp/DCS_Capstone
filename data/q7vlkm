API for check credit card debt?
2021-10-14 19:39:37
Is there an API (service provider) that allows checking how much debt has been accumulated on a credit card and the total available credit?
"['Plaid?', ""So Plaid is typically where you could go, Method is another one wrapping some FIS and Treasury Prime APIs, and Rightfoot is basically wrapping Plaid. The issue is this is all user permissioned, so your conversion will fall but you'll have some transactional data.\n\nOthers to check would be Array or Spinwheel - array is great for the data, Spinwheel gets you data with a phone number, insights and payments (you can stand up a little faster here if you need it). They are also wrapping some tech but not sure what (looks like a mixture of proprietary build and wrapped APIs)"", ""Thanks.\n\nYes, Plaid seem to offer this: [https://plaid.com/docs/liabilities/#liabilities-data](https://plaid.com/docs/liabilities/#liabilities-data)   \nAdditionally, I've found the following services which might provide this info:\n\n[https://methodfi.com/](https://methodfi.com/)\n\n[https://www.rightfoot.com/](https://www.rightfoot.com/)\n\nI am not sure if they have access to this information directly or if they rely on Plaid as well.""]"
