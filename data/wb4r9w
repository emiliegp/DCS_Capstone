"['Denmark: 12% in 2021.\n\nSource: National Bank of Denmark', 'Source? Surprising figures.', ""Including Scandinavia?? People looks at me like i'm from another species when using cash and being late 20s/early 30s in Sweden. \n\nMore than one girl has leaned into my ear in bars to ask in a whisper why I carry cash (assuming i must be a drug dealer). \n\nBarely any store except food chains and Systembolaget (alcohol monopoly owned by the state), and that's just in one or two counters these days, because they are bound to by law to provide this service. \n\nAfter covid not even my two favorite bars will accept cash anymore. Which of course just makes me more inclined to use it. \n\nAnyway, i refuse to believe these stats. We might have a lot of immigrants using cash. They, together with me, the drug dealers and ofc the small but cash fierce oldest generations just can't make up more than 25% of the payments. IF that actually is the case, big ups to all the alcoholic grannys and grampas!""]"
