"How do BNPL companies make $? (i.e. Affirm,  Klarna, Afterpay)

• From consumers: Affirm charges an interest rate (10-30%) on the ""loan"" amounts. Also, Afterpay collected $18.2M in late fees (17% of sales)

• From sellers: merchants usually pay 2\~8% of the purchase amount

"['Critical to remember three things:\n\nThe interest Affirm charges is simple interest (not compounding), and the 10-30% is an APR (not a simple interest calc) - so on a 3 month loan, you might pay 5 or 6% of the sale price in interest, like $15 on a $300 purchase\n\nThese firms also absorb defaults (one default can wipe out the interest/merchant fee upside from a hundred loans)\n\nThey also have their own costs of capital (eg where do they get the money and how much does it cost them)', 'It’s usually an entry level financial service with once the company learns the person can be “trusted” to pay off the BNPL loan they will then offer them more financial Lines of Credit. Since typically BNPL skews younger, financial companies can also sell the data to data brokers and credit bureaus (Lexis Nexis, Innovis, etc.) that’s all I can think of the top of my head. If you’re interested further let me know and I can look deeper into it!', ""Thank you all – u/bamboofighter u/String_Adagio u/dittmer_chris\n\nThese are all very helpful for me and many other students here I'm sure!!"", ""This is pretty much it. Generally it's a loss leading product used to acquire customers to cross sell bigger lines of credit, credit cards, personal loans, car loans etc. Most pure play BNPL companies post regular losses due to the costly acquisition business model. \n\nThey offset losses through merchant fees charged to retailers (Afterpay takes 3-4% of each transaction made with it). Most retailers wear that cost because BNPL offers a new marketing channel and leads to higher value transactions as people spend more."", 'Of course I’m glad I can help out. I actively comment when I can, as FinTech is super interesting and I find there aren’t enough Technical folks who understand the business side as well as they could. Truly is a niche spot']"
