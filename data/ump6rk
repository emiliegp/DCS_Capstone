"We embarking on implementing our first post-quantum enterprise project to within our company and to our counterparts who recieve our corporation's product (tansactions, tansfers, data, etc.). 

Without going into too many details, there are very few resources out there. Though we trust our partners, I've never been in a enterprise deplyment in which i couldn't have a relative comfort level in the technology from outside reaources. Anyone have any experience or reaources in this area?"
