Hello people,

For my master's degree, I'm trying to do a research project about FinTech topics.

I would appreciate if you can help me with answers to the questionnaires in the below links:

Thank you very much in advance"
"['Your questions need improvement', 'You need to change the response fields so people can select all applicable answers', ""Hello guys,\n\nThanks for your comments. I forgot to mention that although I consider I have some good IT skills (including some programming ones), I'm not an IT expert (my workfield is in Finance), so I'd like to ask:\n\n\\- some example of improvement to the questionnaire's questions\n\n\\- I understand that multiple answers might suit for some questions, however if you could please select the best possible answer you can think of? After I get as many asnwers as possible at these questionnaires, I need to use SPSS to make some statistical analysis, and it would be great to have one best answer for each question that requires only one answer. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you very much in advance!""]"
