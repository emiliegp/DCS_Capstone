"I had $40 in a iMToken exchange/wallet I wanted to transfer to my wallet i created with meta mask, total gas fees to transfer from imtoken to this new wallet is $16 of my $39.

Isn't low transaction cost supposed to be a big positive for crypto currencies? 

Why would anyone use crypto with these kinds of fees? I'm very new to crypto (obv) so quite possibly I just am not understanding."
"['There are cryptocurrencies that offer low transaction costs, but right now ethereum is not one of them.', ""Gas fees are a big issue for Eth at the moment. There are other coins that have much faster and cheaper transactions like Solana and Avalanche. Ethereum has more benefit than just being a currency, mind you. But at the moment, it's not lending itself to small transactions."", 'Nope - high transaction costs are one of the major drawbacks.  If you see something talking about low transaction costs and crypto - you are likely looking at some of the specific avenues that are attempting to address the issue.']"
