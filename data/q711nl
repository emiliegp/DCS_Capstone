Landing a fintech internship

"Hi everyone I am a junior year software engineering student and want to break into fintech. My actual goal and dream was investment banking but I don’t have enough connections and since it’s my 3rd year I feel late in game with no prior experience. Going through a constant depression because of this. I will be graduating in 2023 june,   So now I think breaking into fintech looks like a better(?) idea. Is it possible? What would be the best way to prepare for the internships?  Python, R, java are my prior languages btw. Thanks"
