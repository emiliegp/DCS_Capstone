"I am an engineer & software developer specializing in Fintech and I would like to start a blog on the fintech industry. What would be the good topics to write about?  
I am interested in different types of APIs and platforms for Crypto, stock market, payments, etc  
Would you suggest a few topics to start with?"
"['Banking as a service, web 3, the fall of Fintech stocks (Robinhood), the fall of Fintech investment, the opportunity for Fintech in the recession', 'Honestly been writing myself, will start putting on LinkedIn in simple stuff like reviewing an api, talking baas costs , market segmentation â€¦ how processes work', 'Cool. I like it  \nIs there anything more technical that I can write about?', ""Not to be a dick but your blog is gonna run out of steam quite quickly if you can't think of any topics on your own"", 'Is there anything more technical than say Web3 to discuss? \n\nMaybe you should blog about baking instead of banking?']"
