Where does klarna get the money to pay its vendors from? They say they process 2m transactions a day lets say an average transaction is $10 that would be $20m a day and 600m a month and that’s with 10$. They can’t possibly have billions lying around?
"['Treasury Management is a thing and has been for a while.', 'Lol nobody answering direct question…they get it from banks. Show a banker your underwriting process, then add time, then you see default rate..etc. Adjust/improve over time. The better your process and the more time that goes by solidifying that process with improving metrics, the more likely you’ll have access to essentially unlimited money.', 'Klarna makes money via merchant fees, late payment fees, interest on consumer loans, interchange fees, and interest on cash.', 'why do you ask?', 'What do you mean vendors?', 'They publish an annual report with a balance sheet', 'balance sheet is provided to Klarna by banks and credit funds', 'What do u mean', 'Is it prohibited to ask?', 'Merchants*', 'https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasury_management']"
