"To sound more specific, I'd like to add that the fintech industry is indeed flooded with solutions of multiple kinds, which confuses end-users. So I'm just asking for your opinion on the subject of [user experience](http://dashdevs.com/blog/enhancing-customer-experience-fintech-industry-initiatives-to-learn-and-try/?utm_source=article&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=how_to_cope_with_customer_experience) and how much this part of software development is necessary for users who just want to carry out transactions or get paid for something. Any opinion is highly appreciated!"
"[""Like any application - if there's one glaring bug in the polish to an app - people will drop it and not come back. When it comes to fintech, you are consumer based application must have 100% polish, must be extensively tested for bugs, must have fluid, simple design and easy UX / UI.\n\nIt's QA/QC - And like any other product, again, if you don't have it - people will drop it. I suggest solving a problem for an institution and white labeling a mechanic that doesn't even have to make you money - but just launches into the financial industry .\n\nIf that happens, then you can scope out features that will be beneficial and profitable - and then get VC money to go after what you're designing to build. But if your management team is incompetent - and they don't understand the complexities of launching something into the financial world, then you're not going to go anywhere. Trust me, I know this from experience."", 'Thanks for sharing your opinion!']"
