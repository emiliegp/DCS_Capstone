I need investment capital solutions for my fintech
2022-07-09 07:41:33
I want to create a digital firm but I don't have capital. And I'm not licensed. Is there a fintech solution to this?
"['Fintech isn’t going solve you lacking capital or licensing for a new business.', 'I have no idea what you’re even asking', 'Raise capital? Crowdfunding is a pretty low-cost / ""low-barrier"" form of capital raising.', 'Whats the idea?', 'Huh?', 'You need a team and a pitch deck.', ""That's too bad""]"
