West is slow with B2B marketplaces adoption

"B2B marketplaces, notably fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) marketplaces, are gaining steam in the Global South, which includes Latin America, Africa, Asia and ¾ of the world population. Informal commerce is central to these economies, driven by small mom and pop shops and kiosks across major cities and even rural areas. There are 6M of such retailers in India, 7M in China, 2M in Brazil, and 2M in Pakistan, and they carry everything from toiletries to medicine to electronics.  


These retailers are critical to the lifeblood of commerce in these regions, and B2B marketplaces that provide constituents with credit to expand their businesses, guarantee payments and delivery, and software to order and promote products are gaining adoption. The software and financial products built into these marketplaces are extremely sticky, and can be a trojan horse for financial operating systems for retailers, distributors, wholesalers, and manufacturers. In some cases, these marketplaces can even be distribution points for consumer financial services.  


We’ve seen many iterations of this model from Colombia to Indonesia (see below for a non-exhaustive map), and we believe there are two product primitives these marketplaces need to include:  


1. “come for the tool, stay for the network” software for marketplace participants to enable digital transactions and financial management  


2. embedded lending and payments to create liquidity in the marketplaces and to monetize a generally thin margin industry  


While certain marketplaces have centralized logistics to deliver maximum value to retailers (i.e., by replacing the tedious cash and carry routine), others are taking a less capital intensive approach by driving more efficiency to existing distribution networks in the targeted region)."
