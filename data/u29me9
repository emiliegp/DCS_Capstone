"I'm building a venture backed startup that offers the simplest and safest platform to allow fund & treasury managers to invest in high yield, risk-free, and compliant DeFi (decentralized finance). We deal with all the complexities behind the scenes, including wallet security, licenses, on-ramp/off-ramp, etc.

If you manage treasury and are looking for risk-free interest rates of \~5-7%, I would love to get on call and demo our product. Just DM me if interested."
"['Not gonna find c suite on Reddit willing to do a demo off a post.', ""'risk-free interest rates of \\~5-7%', how are you able to guarantee that?""]"
