"['You should understand the business, their prospects, and traction before joining ANY company. The intensity of that due diligence and where you should focus that due diligence will be different depending on the stage (seed vs series A vs series D, etc) and the specific business the company is in. \n\nSo, yes I would, if what I learned about them aligned with my personal risk tolerance. This applies in any macro environment.', 'What difficult environment?', 'Depends on the job and the startup.', 'Agree. How long of a runway should they have before needing financing? 1 year, 2 years?', 'Tech starting to lay off. Wall Street bonuses probably down 50%. Shit is going to hit the fan in the next few months. My clients are getting nervous.', 'I would be very uncomfortable with anything under 12 months right now (ok ok, I’m thinking about the current environment there). But that’s based on my risk tolerance, which is based on my personal and financial obligations. If I were single and renting and felt like the company had great traction I’d be open to higher risk…', 'I keep hearing this recently I’m a couple month in working at a fintech company and we have been hiring a lot… should I be worried?', 'Agree. Prefer 24 months but that is ideal. You have great business sense.', 'The question that is perhaps more important is what valuation they last raised at and whether your equity will ever hit that valuation. Lots of down rounds are coming for late stage fintech. Early stage may be insulated a bit, but that’s case by case I think. Reality is that there was a lot of sweet sweet vc cash for a loooong time and valuation a got very rich - we’ve only just scratched the surface of the implications of the market meltdown on private fintech valuations.', 'Agree. Did you see YC letter to its companies? Very sobering.']"
