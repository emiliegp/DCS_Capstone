SAAS for underwriting loans

"Hi. We're hoping to issue loans to users and underwrite them ourselves ($5-$20k). We have the capital but would prefer not to setup the compliance / technology just yet if we can outsource. Do any fintechs (e.g. Column, SynapseFi, Alviere) allow you to underwrite loans yourself but they'll handle the tech/compliance? Thanks so much"
"['So what WOULD you be doing in this case then? Literally just providing the funds?', 'That’s kind of the most important part, mate. I suppose you might be able to reach out to a start up lender with the tech but not the capital and do \nsomething like that.', 'Yes, Finastra does all this.\n\nhttps://www.finastra.com/solutions/lending/consumer-lending', 'Check out onbo.com', ""Yes. Underwriting the loan and lending the funds. Just requires complex legal / compliance infrastructure that we'd like to outsource to a SAAS to make sure it's done right."", 'Honestly the bit you’re not wanting to do is the hard bit. How are you planning to underwrite the loans, are you building loan origination / decisioning platforms? Have you got a credit risk strategy? Usually someone would just want to borrow funds in large quantities from someone like you and then re lend smaller loans out to individuals.', 'Sorry for lack of context. Long story short, we plan to handle all the underwriting / origination / decisioning / fund provisioning. Realized we essentially just need a lending license. Going to speak to a few banks / consumer lending platforms. If any other thoughts let me know, really appreciate it.']"
