"Hi there - I am essentially looking for advice. I was at a FinTech for over a year in the Wealth Management space where I was worked hard, experienced quite a bit of stress through the year and had tight deadlines. I did enjoy the work eventually and thought it was at the forefront of the industry (pushing boundaries) but then came along an opportunity with an IT consultancy whom were offering a 42% pay rise and the nature of the role is to work with clients project to project, creating a variety of work. 

I accepted this job and am now working in it but so far the work isn't as engaging, it is comfortable and corperate, and I find myself thinking if I have made the right decision. Any advice or questions would be most welcome"
"[""DM'ed."", ""I think only you can say for sure, but generally the lesson here is that a salary, while important, is not the main thing that will keep you working somewhere. The manager, the work, the environment, the opportunity, the satisfaction are also very important. This is not to say that you should accept a job where you are underpaid because everything else is amazing. It's to say that it takes a lot of money to overcome those other things, perhaps more than you thought."", ""Honestly a 42% pay increase is huge, I would say it's a good move. My thought is stay in your role for now, gain the experience they have to give for 18 months or so. Once you have meaningful experience, look to go back into a provider trainer than an consultant. You have a new base pay and you'll probably be able to command another 20% with 18 months of consulting under your belt."", 'The ship has left the port. No way to turn around now.', ""Thanks, but don't see a message in my DM's"", 'Just sent it again.']"
