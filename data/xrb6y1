I would love to hear the communities' recommend top law firms.
"['For what sort of work?', 'I would imagine it depends on the task at hand. Some lawyers do compliance on the products end, others take care of the business end(setting up LLCs for instance). Others do entirely different things.', ""Also depends on the country. I've got good contacts for UK US and FR. Message me if interested."", 'Depends on your budget - but, Burges Salmon are good', ""Paul Hastings  \nPerkins Coie  \n\n\nYou'll be good with either of those. Expect $2000/hr for partner time, but associates should be able to answer most questions. I would try Paul Hastings first."", 'Securities law and weather I would have to register as a security or not.', 'Iâ€™ll consider it a large budget.', 'Thank you!']"
