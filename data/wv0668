"Can anyone recommend a portfolio management software that offers fee, billing, reporting and trading at a minimum?, Targeted towards the financial advisor market and available on a per account feebasis.  Something like Black diamond but without the financial commitment as I scale up."
"['Advyzon', 'Tally', '? Tallys for Credit cards no?']"
