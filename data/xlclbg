"I am part of an API FinTech company going to Money 20/20.  It's our first year going, trying to gauge expectations.  We only have a 10x10 booth, but would like to do something to draw people to us.  Wanting to see what to expect, with how crowded and what kind of crowd.

&#x200B;

Thank you!"
"['what type of business? can you share the company name?', 'The most creative I saw to generate traffic was a booth that had a SNES with Mario kart. Person with the best lap time got a $400 HomePod. Most will \ncollect business cards to draw iPad, Apple Watch, etc. Some also give free booze, which is def a crowd pleaser.', 'Laptop stickers with small QRCodes are popular. You can also embed campaign codes into QR link to track click throughs to your marketing page']"
