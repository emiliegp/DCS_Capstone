"Does anyone know reputable online Fintech funding platform for individual investors? I would like to be invested in funding round, angle round, etc., Thank you!"
"['AngelList may be interesting to you.', ""WeFunder, NetCapital, [Republic.co](https://Republic.co), and StartEngine are a few equity-based crowdfunding platforms you might want to check out.\n\nHowever, most businesses that plan to go public don't use these platforms. The SEC's Reg CF structure for raising capital on crowdfunding platforms can create some problems for companies that wish to go public.\n\nThe company that I founded has been advised by our lawyers, our advisory board members, and Carta (our SEC-registered transfer agent) to avoid these platforms if possible, since it requires an SPV (special purpose vehicle), essentially a subsidiary, to group the investors into a single line item on the cap table.\n\nSo, you might find some great companies on these platforms, but if you're looking to find companies that plan to go public, AngelList might be a better platform to network and establish a name for yourself."", 'Wealthblock', '[deleted]', ""I'm interested too please let me know what you find"", 'You could always pile into defi.', 'Thank you', 'Thanks for your advice. I will try Angellist.', 'I will try it. Thank you', 'You should try Anglelist or Bnktothefuture.', 'My pleasure. Good luck!', 'Try John Garner of VX Global.']"
