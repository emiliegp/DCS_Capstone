Has anyone used KnotAPI's card switcher before?

"['Another user already asked this. I’ll repeat my comment:\n\nThe problem with card-on-file is that for the brand (visa, mc, etc) to properly detect a subscription, it needs the merchant to properly flag it. This doesn’t happen all the time. For example, Visa Card-on-file API has a success of under 50% (meaning it will return less than have the subscriptions a card is saved). Because of this you have companies like First Performance which takes the historic transaction data (13 months at least) and will move the success rate to 80-90%).\n\nAfter that, then you can check migration solutions such as Knot or Card Dynamics which are integrated with major merchants to allow migrating a subscription from one card to another. Bottom line is, changing card-on-file is not as simple as it looks.', 'I have heard that KnotAPI detects the subscriptions on behalf of the user, and the user can add others if it missed any. It does this based on historic transaction data.', 'Exactly, just like First Performance. For that you need 13 months worth of transactions to achieve a 90% success. 6 months worth of transactions would lower the success rate around 70%.']"
