What is the way you communicate in your company?

"Hi there people,  
In our little (600) FinTech company we are looking to find out what works and what does not work for you in your companies regarding communication. Is it email? Is it Slack, or anything else?  
We see that our Slack channels are all over the place, weekly company-wide is no longer cutting it, our leaders are hesitating to officially introduce email as a way to go.   


Is there anything that you and your company doing that make it real special?? Am I missing something?"
"['We had e-mail, now use https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira', 'Jira likely makes the most sense if your dev teams use it. We like notion, jira and slack', 'Email and Teams', 'If your company requires speed and fast decision making then it makes sense to focus on building a culture were people walk over and/or pick up the phone/zoom for communication. That works way better than email or ticketing systems in getting through challenges and making decisions. You would need some of the regular email/docs/ticketing tools for recordkeeping afterwards.']"
