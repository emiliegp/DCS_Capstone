What are you looking for in a stock data API?

"Hello,

I've been working on a stock data API for the past few weeks and have been wondering:

* What are the most sought out for features?
* What kind of pricing seems acceptable?  
There is barely any cost for me to run it, other than hosting and an S3 storage server.
* What kind of subscription model do you prefer? (Pay per call, fixed monthly fee, etc.)

**The current features I have:**

* Coverage over every market
* Real time quotes (Open, Close, High, Low, Adj Close, Volume)
* Past quote
* Changes (Between 2 dates)
* Dividend History
* Ticker lookup (Could be used for a search bar, similar to yahoo finance's search bar)

**What I plan to add next:**

* Income statements
* Balance sheets"

Actually started this project for personal need and because I cant afford a 400$ per month api.\n\nPricing would be way lower.
