How to start a fintech company?

Hello there!

I'm particularly interested in building a fintech app. I read a lot about [fintech startup ideas](https://dashdevs.com/blog/how-to-start-a-fintech-company-and-make-it-successful-p1/) and offers, but I still have lots of questions about apps development. What's the cost? What to look out for before I start? Is there any legal compliance? Maybe you can give me advice?  

Many thanks in advance!"
