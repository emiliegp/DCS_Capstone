"Anyone here using a loan management software for your ledgering?
If so, which one? What are you paying? Do you like it/what do you not like?"
"['Interested', 'For what type of lending?', 'We just built this at www.integrated.finance', 'PeachFinance.com without question has the best tech out right now in this space. Only available in US for now.', 'To be clear we built a generalised transaction ledger that accommodates a lot more than that but loan management is a core part of it. Note we donâ€™t accommodate negative balances -\nWe accommodate auxiliary accrued fee accounts.']"
