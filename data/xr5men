"Hi! I'm preparing school project on fintech ideas and due to lack of personal experience, I decided to do this survey. Tell me, do you experience paying problems that deserve more attention than they get from government or private sector? What are they? Any answers are welcome, thanks in advance"
"['Specific example: Multiple partial capture (split shipment) for bnpl transactions.huge pita \n\nGeneral example: payments fraud…no shortage of content there.', 'As a consumer, the time a transaction can take can be so long. Some companies can have a transaction show up on my bank account tomorrow, other could take a whole month before I actually get charged for what I bought (currently dealing with this now from a fintech, it a great company so I don’t mind, but that could definitely be a problem).', 'I’m someone who is fairly conscience of germs, and it really bothers me that I can use my debit card with Apple Pay but then I’m asked to touch the key pad for my PIN.', 'Lack of real time payments']"
