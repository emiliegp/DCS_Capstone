Stock Market Screener API
2022-07-24 07:20:04
"Hi, 

I am looking for an API that will screen the stock market either for free or relatively cheap. 

With the API I would like to ask a user within an app some questions such as ‘what market would you like to trade?’. Then, based on their selection, the stocks screener changes and lists all the stocks to the user.

I have found APIs such as Financial Modelling Prep and Intrinio however, they are quite expensive and I’m not sure if they would do what I want. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated:)"
