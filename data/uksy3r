"I am thinking of writing a series of articles on fintech. Just for fun and hopefully to stir my career in   
this direction. Does anybody have any experience with this? 

I am a little concerned that my articles could be lost in among a huge number of existing blogs.. It is hard to stand out now..

Any ideas on where to publish it?"
"['Start with LinkedIn\n\nI write fintech articles and I have met interesting people.', 'No. Itâ€™s all the same shit.', 'I would say when you are just starting LinkedIn is your best bet. Maybe start your own blog and then build  following on Twitter to promote your stuff.', 'Contact AtlanticFintech.ca, they look for content', 'Interesting that someone was able to succeed in this with this huge amount of blogs. How did you start? Can you share more insights?', 'Networking can build the number of people interested in your content. I joined Finance networking groups. Find fintech subjects that interest you and share those details with your audience in blog articles on a personal website. Promote your most viewed articles on LinkedIn as posts.   Use Creator mode on LinkedIn to add your most popular articles to your profile. Use your tagline and profile to identify as a fintech writer. \n\nComment on fintech subjects and do some public speaking to improve your brand. \n\nYou may get approached to write for other blogs. Look into ghostwriting fintech content. Say yes to all fintech writing opportunities that come your way. \n\nI was eventually contacted by a publisher. I pay for editing, but they publish my articles to again build my writer brand. \n\nGrind it out and opportunities will come your way.']"
