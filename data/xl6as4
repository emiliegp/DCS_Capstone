"I am 18 years of age, going into university rather soon, still kinda blurry on what to pursue, I have an education of statistics-computer science background including a recent rise of wanting to study economics. With all this combined I stumbled across fintech being a viable career. What necessary steps must I take to get into fintech? What jobs will be available to me? Any programming languages required?"
