2022-03-11 02:40:20
"I'm a copywriter working with a fintech marketing agency. Got a few questions, wondering if the community here has the answers.   


1. What are the biggest challenges or pain points a fintech company faces when it comes to marketing?
2. What are the biggest objections or hesitations a fintech company has when it comes to hiring a marketing agency? 
3. What are the main goals that a fintech company has when they partner with a marketing agency?

Any advice or insights on these questions would be much appreciated.   


Many thanks in advance.
