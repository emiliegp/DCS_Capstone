"['Imagine spending heaps of money and time into developing a “product” that Google Chrome just embeds by default for free for both the consumer and seller.', 'How does the founder get vast sums of money after his prior startup tanked and he was accused of fraud in AU? What happened to investor due diligence? Guess it’s all fake.', '$600k ARR and raised $131million…..I think there’s a tech bubble', 'Fail FAST!\n\n✅ Done', 'Well it lives up its name', 'This firm in the down under went...bottom up ! \nI would recommend the affected Aussies to jump to Revolut which is licences to operate in Australia and stable/profitable.', ""US based VC investors couldn't read the news articles from Australia because the writing was upside down."", 'No there’s incompetent vcs', 'Agree ! No due diligence performed. How did they spend the money ? What analysis was performed on the claims to achieve certain unit economics ?']"
