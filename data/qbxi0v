"['Would be neat to see what % of market share is baked into the valuation as an assumption.', 'Money laundering paying off…', 'Check out FEXDU, new Fintech SPAC, went public YESTERDAY.', 'What do you mean?', ""They're growing regardless of or because they don't really care for regulations regarding money laundering. Just last month they had to pay a fine of more than four million euros to Bafin (the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority) because of this."", 'maybe they have aspirations to achieve HSBC levels of money laundering and become a ""real"" bank', 'I think the German regulators consider them already as too big to fail. N26 is one of Germanys few ""prestigious"" showcase startups. And after the fall of Wirecard probably the only remaining one in the financial industry.', 'I don\'t think it\'s about prestige. N26 is basically the leader of innovation in the personal banking experience in Europe. I\'d imagine if you let them fall then confidence in innovation in the sector drops, reliance on the old shit banks return and things slow down again.\n\n(yes, you can argue Revolut is larger and maybe developed features quicker but it wasn\'t a ""bank"" per se until much more recently)', 'I don\'t know. I may be biased, because my N26 experience a few years ago was absolutely subpar. (Also they haven\'t been a ""bank"" in the beginning too, basically they were a Wirecard frontend).']"
