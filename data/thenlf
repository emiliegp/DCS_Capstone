Bank Amazonization: The keys to a successful business model in the banking sector
2022-03-19 07:42:47
"Change is weighing more and more on European banks and financial institutions that are losing their competitive edge. Theyâ€™re currently experiencing difficulties with customer relations and regulations that increase requirements on payments and loans alone. Therefore, banks should look elsewhere. They need to take advantage of ongoing developments in #OpenBanking. Banks should become aggregators not only of their own products but of othersâ€™ products too.

&#x200B;

This means leveraging technology and regulations to determine where to increase profitability, while still providing excellent customer service.

A new business model: Amazonization ðŸ’¡

&#x200B;

Regulations such as #PSD2 and Open Banking are changing what customers want while reshaping the banking landscape. This will lead to a significant change in banksâ€™ future business models. New players, fintech companies, and neobanks, without any process or legacy backing, are taking advantage of the situation and entering the market with a robust online offer. In addition, theyâ€™re more transparent in terms of pricing and realize that data is their most valuable asset in developing their offerings. They also operate beyond their borders and are easy to use across Europe, whether opening an account, executing a transaction, or viewing accounts.

&#x200B;

Incumbent players in Europe are struggling with high costs and the need for considerable investment due to legacy IT systems and competition from new entrants. Nowadays, traditional banks are facing a multi-pronged attack on their operations from neo-banks (or Challenger Banks), fintech companies, and big tech.

Amazonization as a response to market threats?

&#x200B;

The notion of Amazonization is a phenomenon born out of the large-scale disruption in the retail industry caused by Amazon. The company was born in the initial dot-com era, and its growth has been exponential since 2010, with the retail giant increasing more than fivefold in value.

&#x200B;

Amazonization refers to a shift in power to the customer. If you apply that shift to the financial services industry, platforms will become the dominant, customer-facing user interface. Platform customers will be able to search, buy and manage products. They will be offered the best price and value for their needs according to their parameters, which they set on the platform. In addition, they will be able to see other buyersâ€™ comments and opinions before making their choice. European banks must adopt the concept of Amazonization and become product aggregators, thus providing one-stop-shopping to meet their customersâ€™ banking needs.

"[""Hi, I completely agree. But perhaps we also need to include the other 100 pound gorilla in this, Ant Financial.
