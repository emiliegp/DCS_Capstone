Service to import bank transactions automatically in Australia.

"Which service can I use to import transactions from my bank accounts into finance app I use?

Long story short, I have 10 bank accounts including personal, credit cards, business account, emergency fund, overseas funding account etc. In 4-5 different banks. 

Now that open banking API and things are picking up, is there a way in AUSTRALIA to get my bank transactions imported into my finance program automatically? (I understand I will need a developer who will do for me)

I currently have to log into banks and download Excel transactions each week, then import manually. Hate doing that."
