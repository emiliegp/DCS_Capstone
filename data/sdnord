Access to raw transaction data of all my accounts across banks
2022-01-27 13:42:14
"HI all,

I am looking to get access to transaction data of all my accounts (debit, savings, credit cards) across all my banks. I want to sort of build my own budget overview. I have tried multiple apps and none of them offer what I need.  

&#x200B;

Am I right that I am looking for a service like Plaid? Is there any other service I should investigate? I only need it for myself, not trying to build a commercial product here.

&#x200B;

Thank you"
"[""Yeah, Plaid can do this. For the use case you're describing (just pulling data from your own personal accounts) it would be free."", 'TrueLayer, SaltEdge or Yodlee - depending on which market youâ€™re in.', 'Thank you!']"
