"Hi there! I'm in Lending Tech and trying to find a good LOS. What do you recommend?  


Edit:  


We support direct-to-consumer and indirect lending programs. We have multiple financing sources and indirect lending partnerships across almost every industry but mortgage lending. I would love to get your thoughts on your experience with your LOS in your industry and/or lending vertical."
