"Please excuse any incorrect wording as I'm definitely out of my depth on this project. I would appreciate any tips or recommendations. 

I work for a nonprofit that issues grants to other nonprofits. My boss wants to issue at least 75% of our grants via ACH instead of mailing checks. We make about 12,000 grants a year to around 4,000 organizations. 

Right now we verify the account number, routing number, and account owner identity using PNC Bank's Verify + Authenticate tool. It uses the GIACT database to verify the info. But a significant portion of our grantees use smaller banks that aren't in the database; so, we often just get the ""no info found"" response and end up just sending more checks. 

My boss doesn't like the idea of microdeposits because if someone provides us with their personal bank account number instead of the nonprofit's, then they'll still be able to verify the microdeposit. 

What other services can we use that might help solve this problem?

I've talked to Plaid, and they gave me a minimum of $1k a month. I've got a demo with MX on Tuesday. 

Any other suggestions?"
"['https://www.routingnumber.com/', 'MX and Plaid are first things that come to my mind. Next thing I\'d try is Teller.\n\nFull list of other options is available here:  \n[https://www.awesomefintech.com/category/automation-in-banking/](https://www.awesomefintech.com/category/automation-in-banking/)  \n\n\nAlso I\'d try to analyze 4000 bank account holistically and group the ones that return ""no info found"" and try to structure by location and bank, and then address the top banks by integrating directly with them. It\'s slightly more work, but you\'d get better ROI for same $12K/annually.\n\nAnother path you can take it to do KYC/KYB and ID management like Trulioo, here\'s another  list:\n\n[https://www.awesomefintech.com/category/identity-management/](https://www.awesomefintech.com/category/identity-management/)', '[deleted]', 'Yodlee', 'Iâ€™d also check out https://teller.io as well.', 'Thanks!', 'Thank you!', 'This is good to know! I already ruled out some payment outsourcing opportunities with certain vendors because their practices were out of line with our mission statement. \n\nDefinitely looking forward to learn more about MX on my call next week.', 'We are also using Yodlee and my boss has asked me to do some research into KYC/KYB functions of Yodlee.   \nFrom what I have read, Fastlink 4 Verification Plus Aggregation seems to be the way to go.  \n\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Is the company you are working for doing it this way?', 'If your users are in the USA, FL4 is the way to go. Huge upgrade from FL3', 'Thanks for the tip. Based in Australia but from my research it should run the same', 'Yes I forgot to mention AUS should be fine too!']"
