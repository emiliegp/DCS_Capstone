"['The idea of fintech as a major is insane to me. Study in depth some section of finance or economics that is interesting to you and take some class in product management and sql.', 'Actually seems ok for a core curriculum for first two semesters. The upper courses are where you;re going to get what is actually useful. I would suggest posting that.', 'I don’t understand what a BS in FinTech is. That’s just an industry, I’d think you’d want to get a degree in a field - engineering, marketing, law, engineering management etc and you might do a FinTech elective? Very strange to me and just seems like a generic business Degree that is being branded as “FinTech”', 'No banking?', 'Get a double major in finance and Econ then masters in CS.', 'I agree. The curriculum actually seems pretty strong, but the FinTech major might not translate in the future, in different countries, or to certain industries.  I think a standard Business major with a CS minor is what OP should look into']"
