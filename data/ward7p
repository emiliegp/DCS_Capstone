What is letting Bask Bank give interest rates as high as 2%? Would my money be safe with them? Trying to figure out if there is some catch I'm not understanding

"['You would have to read the terms on that specific bank. But \nIts common for banks with high interest rates to either impose a  waiting period on withdrawals and/or limit the amount of withdrawals in a month before they impose a fee.', 'check out HMbradley.', ""I wish I read the real reviews of bask bank before I sent them a big deposit to get their savings yield.  They put fraud alerts on everyone's transfers out and hold your funds in limbo for a long time.  I have no idea when the issue will be resolved.  Customer service is the worst in the industry.  I have used Bank of America, US Bank, Citi, Schwab, First Republic, other high yield banks and never experienced anything this bad.  The bank should be investigated by the CFPB and other regulatory agencies because something nefarious is going on there.  Do not put money there.  Buy t-bills instead."", 'What are t-bills????', 'How do you buy T-bills?', ""U.S. treasury notes with a tenor of  1 year or less (e.g. 3 month treasury note is a t-bill.  If you know you don't need cash for a month or several, t-bill rates might be higher than a savings account.  Very liquid market so you should also be able to sell them efficiently if needed.""]"
