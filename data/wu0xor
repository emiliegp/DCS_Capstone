"Ando doesn't seem to be accepting new members

There is quontic bank though

The only use case I have thought of is: 
- don't have 2% cashback credit card 
- or a purchase is above your limit for the 1.5% cashback credit cards you have"
"[""You are right. The use cases are limited in my opinion.  Paying rent online is one use case. Many rent paying platforms charge exorbitant fees to use a credit card. Debit cards are charged small flat rate.\n\nUsing it with bill pay systems that don't except credit cards, like Paypal Bill pay, is another use case.""]"
