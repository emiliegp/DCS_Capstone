Dui in California and fin tech job
2022-02-19 05:41:35
Hi I got a dui and am looking to get a fin tech job in California. I’ve been working at a bank for the last 2 years. My dui was a misdemeanor and I am currently in my probation. I was sentenced to 3 years probation and have completed a little over half. Is it likely to be able to get a job in fin tech with my circumstance or not?
"['It’s unlikely.  Hiring people on probation represents a risk to the company that they can mitigate easily by just not hiring you.', '“Have you been found guilty of a crime?”', 'What did you blow?', ""My personal opinion, you can set up a shop on your own and don't have to worry. Big fintech shops may pass you over. Having a bankruptcy is a bigger deal than dui. What's your skill set anyway? DM please."", ""Doesn't get more risk free than not hiring a liability."", 'I was found guilty of dui. I blew a .13. Gave me 3 years probation and I’ve completed 2 years of it', '[deleted]', 'What is that, like 3 beers?', 'O ok I get what you’re saying. In California they “ban the box” that asks if you’ve been convicted of a crime. But I get what you’re saying about being honest about it, admitting your mistake, and saying what you learned from it, and how you won’t make the mistake again.']"
