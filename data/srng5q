"Hi all! 

I'm looking for some recent statistics on the volume distribution of the different ACH return codes, at least among the more popular ones (R01 etc.)

I've checked the Nacha, Fed and other processor websites, but couldn't find this info. 

Any pointers in this regard will be very helpful.

Thanks!"
