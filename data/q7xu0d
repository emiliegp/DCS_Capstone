Looking to become appointed representative or tied agent

"Hello,

I am building a fintech platform in Europe and I am intending to provide investment services within the EU area. 

I am looking for companies that work with the appointed representative or tied agent model so I can leverage their licenses and passport throughout EU countries. There are a lot of such firms in UK but Brexit is preventing us from working with them.

Anyone know of any EU licensed companies which we would be able to work with them?

Thanks"
