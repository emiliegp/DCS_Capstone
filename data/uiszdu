"Hi everyone,

So I’m studying a Finance degree and we have a module on Fintech, where our first assignment is to ‘Present a Fintech to the Class’. Super inventive I know. But I want to make mine as interesting as possible and I was wondering if you guys knew any super cool innovative Fintechs that you would choose in my situation? I’m pretty into crypto and I have a few ideas, but I’m open to anything."
"['Depend on what fintech niche you want to mention, but if you want to talk about online banks use this https://fintechwave.substack.com/p/how-to-launch-an-online-bank?s=w', 'Fintech has some really interesting companies right now. My advice is to consider what are the interesting challenges in Fintech right now: open finance, serving minorities, security, etc. Find an interesting problem and then look at the companies attempting to solve that problem.', 'I would say open banking data and APIs is very interesting niche to talk about, it has a lot potential in development for the future, specially in the EU.', 'There are some cool Indian fintechs to explore cred(credit card bill payment), credavenue(lending as a service), onemoney(creditcard), simpl(bnpl)', 'Numerai Competition and dao']"
