What is the difference between a fintech and a neobank?
2021-12-03 16:20:27
I've been reading about neobanks and they seem to have similar functions as a fintech. Is the only difference how the company is registered?
"['FinTech is just financial technology, so pretty much any tech that is used for financial purposes. A neobank is bank that’s completely online(no physical buildings). \n\nSo a neobank is fintech! But fintech isn’t limited to just banking.\n\nHope this answer helped <3', 'Only thing to add to the above is that “neobank” is just a marketing term.  They aren’t really banks—they don’t have the capital or FDIC insurance that a true bank will have.  As a result, they have to partner with “real” banks to provide their banking services.  The “neobank” is really just the technology/interface that stands between the consumer and the actual bank.', 'Yes thank you!', 'This^']"
