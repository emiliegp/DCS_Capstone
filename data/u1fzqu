"Every fintech company works only in a number of countries. Even Paypal and Payoneer are not available everywhere. Why is that so?

Are regulations an issue? Is rolling out in a new market expensive and may not be profitable in other countries? Or there's something else?"
"['In the event that a fintech company is a money services business, a securities broker dealer, operating an exchange/marketplace, or some other strictly regulated practice, they are typically registered, licensed and able to operate in a defined jurisdiction. Getting regulated in any jurisdiction takes time and resources and is not always a good business decision. If companies perform activities or offer services of a regulated entity in a jurisdiction in which they are not regulated/licensed, they open themselves up to litigation by that jurisdiction’s governing body which can be very expensive and time consuming.', ""I'm pretty far from the pulse of regional strategy, but I'd assume regulation and foreign exchange risk are both large factors here."", 'FinTechs operate in 135+ countries, and major ones are concentrated around financial and technology hubs. \n\nRegulations, as you spotted, is the main reason, but not the only one. Another one is ecosystem and also technology.\n\nHere’s a full list of FinTech countries:\n\nhttps://www.awesomefintech.com/countries/']"
