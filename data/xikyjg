"Hey everyone, I’m working on some YouTube content around FinTech because I believe it’s a great industry with lots of interest! I am wondering what your thoughts are on top FinTech roles for people who are on the business side of the industry (Product, Client facing, sales, solutions, strategy and director roles, product implementation). Any thoughts on the spectrum would be helpful!
My aim is to make it more apparent what potential career paths and options there are out there for people, not just SWE or Product Managers and potential salaries to aim for. Any insight is greatly appreciated."
