Title plz
"[""When it produces the technology needed to process or analyze financial transactions as its core value proposition.\n\n\nIEX Cloud is what I'd call a Fintech company.\n\n\nBanks are generally not what I'd call a Fintech company. Processing and analyzing financial transactions are part of its business, but they aren't producing the tools - they're using them.\n\n\nMicrosoft Office is also not a Fintech company. While it produces tools like Windows and .NET that are used in Fintech applications, that is not the value proposition of either one."", ""Well, the term itself means any business that applies technology to automate and improve financial services and processes.  And I would debate an opinion that banks aren't fintech. Mobile banking is a large part of the fintech industry, don't you think so? Moreover, cryptocurrency, investment, trading, insurance are all related to fintech too. Lots of [software development companies](http://dashdevs.com/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=article) are centring around this huge industry in fact! Anyway, I guess if you're somehow related to finance and technology, you can call your business fintech."", 'If your product involves financial services in pretty much any way, you’re a fintech company.  If your product doesn’t directly involve financial services, but uses them somehow, you’re fintech-enabled.', 'That was really helpful thank you. \nSo basically, if a company creates tools to integrate with government public databases to make access to data easier, then,, it is not a fintech. Right?', 'Love that, tnx!', ""> you’re fintech-enabled\n\nand if your office is located near another fintech, you're fintech-adjacent."", "">If your product involves financial services in pretty much any way, you’re a fintech company.  If your product doesn’t directly involve financial services, but uses them somehow, you’re fintech-enabled.\n\nI think it's about much more than just the service. A fintech can also develop technologies or concepts without using a financial service."", ""...Probably not. Although it would depend on what kinds of databases. If they were exclusively financial / accounting government databases, and you marketed them exclusively as a finance product / upstream data vendor for other finance products, then you could make an argument that your company is a fintech company.\n\n\nReally, in my opinion it's quite company / culture / context specific. I think fintech is somewhat of a buzzword these days, and that's not helping a formal definition any."", 'Yes', 'Interesting, thank you so much for taking the time to educate me ♡ appreciate that']"
