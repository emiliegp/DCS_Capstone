Need your advice! Is GDPR a one-off thing?

" I'm about to launch my business and I was told I need to get a privacy document. Someone advised I use that of a similar brand, but I don't think this is right. I came across [www.Privasee.co.uk](http://www.privasee.co.uk/) some days ago; has anyone used this service or something similar before? Can you share your experience? Do I need to continuously update my privacy document?"
"['I work in data protection and I agree with whoever you spoke to, just use a similar business one and adapt it for your purposes. \n\nThe whole point of the privacy policy is that it’s readable by anyone so you won’t have loads of legal terms and jargon to sort through and it will be easy to adapt. \n\nI havent used privasee but you will likely need to update it from time to time as your uses of data change and you realise you don’t have something covered. You will have to give Privasee all of the information about what you do and I think it will be much quicker (and free) to just use another companies one and adapt it. \n\nHonestly, if you are just launching a small business GDPR doesn’t need to be a big concern for you, the regulator (ICO) is too swamped to care about most medium size businesses so any small business is well off their radar.', ""Hey u/Chronic_Wiggles, I'm in a similar situation...  \n\n\nI thought about just copying it but I've been looking at the ICO website and I can see fines to companies ranging from 5 to 55 employees all the way up to bigger ones. So not really sure if there is no risk.\n\nWhen do you think a company should start worrying about GDPR?   \n\n\nSome of the examples of fines I've found:\n\nhttps://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/the-money-hive-limited-en/  \nhttps://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/first-choice-selection-services-limited/  \nhttps://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/emailmovers-limited/"", 'Thanks for this, really helpful! But how do I know an adopted privacy policy pretty much captures the relevant information and is suited for my business? Trying to play safe', 'It depends a lot on what the company in question does. If you aren’t sending huge amounts of junk email messages and aren’t outright ignoring people that send in queries or requests you will be fine. \n\nThe ICO is quite pragmatic and as long as you are making genuine efforts proportional to the data you hold (which for a small business will usually be minimal) then you are unlikely to get into any sort of issue with the ICO. If they do end up investigating and find an issue they are also more likely to give you an Enforcement Action (make you change the issue) than a fine. Fines are generally only for egregious actions or companies that have shown a complete disregard for the law.', 'start with one from a similar business that is large and reputable (i.e. you would expect them to have lawyers / DP experts draft their policy) and then just amend that one. They will include everything that is required and so if you just remove the parts that are not relevant to you it will leave you with what is required. \n\nIf you have any very niche or specialist parts of your business you may need to add something in but honestly if you read one you will realise how simple they are and if you understand your business you will easily understand enough to amend one already as it’s really just the sections that are important. The ICO also has good resources on what needs to be included.\n\nHonestly for most small businesses it is probably no longer than 2/3 pages so you are likely blowing the complexity and risk of getting it wrong out of proportion in your mind.']"
