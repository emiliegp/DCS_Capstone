"I'm just weighing things before making a serious step. Is [data science in fintech](http://dashdevs.com/blog/data-science-in-the-fintech-industry/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=data_science_use_cases) worth it? I've read many article about this area but still hesitating because it will probably require a degree, yeah? Any thoughts and ideas will help me a lot! Thanks in advance."
"['I see a lot of talk about ""Becoming an X in fintech"" (programmer, data scientist, marketer, whatever). And IMO it\'s really no different to other domains. If you are good at your technical skill you will be in demand anywhere. \n\nData science in fintech is just data science.', ""So, no specifics at all, you consider? In a way, I see what you mean but still don't abandon the niche peculiarities. For instance, would you care that much about card management issues, payment approval, or user financial behaviour in terms of data if it's not a fintech? Though there is some universal knowledge, the domain also influences how your handle data and which specific challenges you'll have."", ""I think one thing to keep in mind is things are moving very quickly in fintech. Standards are changing on a quarterly basis in this industry as market leaders are trying to establish themselves. A degree won't help you with this. Your instructors will be years behind what the industry is doing. \n\nI don't think the question is whether you need a degree. It's whether you have the ability to learn quickly and re-adapt constantly in a disruptive environment.""]"
