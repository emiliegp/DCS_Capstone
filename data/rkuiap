"['Hi! I’m currently approaching my last two months of the Penn LPS FinTech program. Definitely was worth it since I’m a complete beginner at programming.

I am very much interested in the Penn LPS Fintech program.

Therefore, is it difficult to get into the program? (I really don’t want to spend money on tickets and a visa for nothing)', 'You have to pass a logic test and that’s it. I don’t know why’d you have to come to the US, when I started the class a couple people were located outside the US. Call the school before you spend the money coming to the US. Everything is online, using zoom calls for lessons and the assignments are 100% online.', 'Do you have contacts of students who were outside the US? I wonder how they were accepted because even though I applied for online education, the school refused me because of my location :(', 'I don’t have their contact information because they ended up dropping the course, but they did end up coming to the US part way through the course. So maybe they have homes here and that’s why they got accepted(I can’t confirm that). But definitely contact the school before making any decisions', 'ok. Thank you very much!', 'No problem, let me know if you need any help. And if you do end up in the course let me know, I’d be happy to help you in any way I can']"
