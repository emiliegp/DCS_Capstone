"What does a sales associate do at a fintech startup?

I have an interview coming up and would like to what the job entails.  It's my first sales job coming from a technical educational background. 

Some points from job description: 

\- Develop customized proposals that help articulate COMPANY NAME benefits, and drive sales for Merchants and Partners 

\- Develop, plan, and monitor COMPANY NAME category sales pipeline, and plan initiatives to both build pipeline activity, and encourage transactions 

\- This role is measured on new account acquisition targets 

  
What would a day to day schedule look like for this position? any insight is appreciated"
"['Lots of cold calling, prospecting new accounts to chase, running discovery calls, qualifying leads, and a lot more cold calling\n\nIt’s a tough job, working an entry level sales job is the coal face, very target and KPI heavy. You should be aim to become an account executive within 1-2 years which is when you start getting properly rewarded for the work you’ve been putting in', 'Allot of customer engagement and sales support. Sounds like a good opportunity to learn. It’s allot of repetitive admin but it’s what you make of it. Good luck.', 'The smaller the company, the more you’ll be responsible for… which is a good thing if you’re trying to make a name for yourself; Bad thing if you’re looking for a 9-5. I would not expect a schedule at most startups.']"
