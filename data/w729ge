"Hey Folks,  
Long time reader, first time poster! I'm the cofounder of Finch ([finchmoney.com](https://finchmoney.com)).  
We've built a platform to invest & build credit as you spend. 

We're looking for beta testers as we grow our customer base (Apple App Store only, for now). If there are any early fintech adopters here who want to try it out please DM me and I can share an invite code!  


Appreciate you all  
Neel"
"['What bank is issuing the cards?', ""1. Ditch the debit card. Why would a MC credit card not be accepted. If you are setting the OTB on the CC in real time based on the cash in their bank account why would you opt for a lower interchange? Unless there's some requirement to have the debit card under the sponsor bank agreement (via synpase). \n2. Go build on corecard and a real bank as soon as you can afford to switch off of synapse\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's a cool product. HMbradley has done very well driving a similar niche. I would image you need to attract big spenders to get MC world elite and thus higher interchange. Good luck!"", 'Would love to help with your testing, not necessarily as a participant, but if you need assistance with the structure of your user research or any element of your research strategy!', ""Hey Neel, looks great! Investment is a popular fintech direction. I wish you good luck with your project. Feel free to dm me if you'll need help with further development. I work for a [fintech software development company](https://mobidev.biz/services/fintech-software-development) specializing in adopting advanced technologies like AI/ML, AR and blockchain. If you want to add cool features to your product, we will be happy to help."", 'Would love to be a beta tester. I tried signing up on the app, but for some reason it gave me an error. I tried contacting your customer service but they were not helpful. She just told me you guys could not open an account for me. Is there a reason for that? I have every fintech bank imaginable and for some reason you guys and Juno (OnJuno) are the only ones I’ve ever had a problem opening an account with. Really bummed out because it sounds like a great idea. Hope you could help.', 'Interested !', 'It looks like its through Synapse so probably Evolve or Meta.', 'Evolve Bank & Trust is our partner bank & card issuer.', 'Appreciate the advice!  \n\n\nWe do currently issue on credit, which is how we can offer such high cash back (which is auto-invested).  \n\n\nThanks for the kind words - would love for you to try it out!', 'That would be awesome. DM’ing you!', 'DM’ing you!', 'Thought so but they weren’t named, so I thought maybe there were other partners now.', 'When looking for a card issuer, what was the process like?', 'Thank you!']"
