"Hey there,

I'm the founder of a VC-backed fintech startup, and we could use some extra hands. 

DM me if you're interested in an internship + get your feet wet in fintech."
"['Hey there! I’m a software engineer at Marqeta, previously at SynapseFI and have been mentoring a new grad to begin his career in software engineering. Can I make an introduction for him to meet you and the team?', 'Hi there @OP! I’m a veteran and recently graduated a coding bootcamp that focuses C# and .Net Framework and have a knowledge with restful APIs and mssql database. Is there an opportunity to apply as an intern or apprentice?', 'Hi, I would be super interested. Give me a pm!', ""Hi @OP what's the idea?"", 'May i ask how is the interview process for data engineer intern at Marqeta? I appreciate all the information. Thank you.', 'I believe it’s similar to a software engineering intern.  You can expect a couple round of leetcode easy questions and a behavioral interview as well.']"
