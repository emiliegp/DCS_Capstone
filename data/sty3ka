"Some see financial technology as complicated software or platforms that only managers or accountants know how to use, but it is not limited. 

When we talk about FinTech, we also refer to how we access our financial situation. For example, more and more people access their banks through digital platforms, and virtual transactions are increasing exponentially. 

Fact: Apple pay alone makes up 92% of the mobile wallet transactions in the US.

Enough of keeping money under the mattress, lol"
"[""I agree. There has been exponential growth in use of digital payments for peer to peer transactions while also helping merchants accept payments using PoS.\n\nI guess  the 'complicated' version of Fintech as some view it largely refers to some of the products offered by companies like Stripe/Square that require a basic understanding of accounting and financial concepts before integrating them into your business. One could cite their product that simplify calculating taxes, raising captial or even incorporating a Delaware corp.\n\nThese products and services are only going to reduce the burden on accountants/finance departments in an organisation. But you still need to know the concepts while interacting with the product which is why some are not aware/understand the entire capabilities of the Fintech ecosysytem (Excluding P2P transactions using Cashapp/Venmo etc.)"", 'I’m not quite following you. Financial technology is not becoming common, it was always very common. Not always convenient, but always very common. \n\nWhat you seem to mean is that digital part of Fintech is growing, but it’s kind of obvious.']"
