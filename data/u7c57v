"Hi everyone! I am a Ukrainian, working for a Lithuanian-Ukrainian fintech company, and now my country is fighting for democracy and freedom.

Apart from volunteering, donating and hiding in the bomb shelters during air raid alerts, me and my colleagues continue working, doing what we’re good at - this is our contribution to the information war.

We’ve collected the top fintech influencers’ forecasts on how fintech will react to the Russian aggression and the sanctions imposed on this country. I am sure this is something that the fintech community is now worried about, so you're welcome to check it out.[https://sdk.finance/future-of-fintech-because-of-war-in-ukraine/](https://sdk.finance/future-of-fintech-because-of-war-in-ukraine/?fbclid=IwAR1rugQgE-rh8Lu9Flfa5NnzIpItHFiRnUHAYsCR-jk3Ex5CD4CanhjfVgU)

Would be great if you shared your own view of the situation with fintech. What do you think?"
"['I believe that war in Ukraine will accelerate crypto adoption. \n\nSome time ago, they put a new law in place that will allow crypto exchanges to operate in a more regulated environment and not be limited to crypto-friendly suppliers. It means that converting crypto to fiat money in Ukraine will be easier than ever before.']"
