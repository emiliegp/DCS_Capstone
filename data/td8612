Does anyone have any banks they would recommend for easy ACH access for a fintech? Specifically looking for same day ACH credits.
"['Payment companies, like Moova, Sila, or Stripe do.', 'Your fintech needs to be able to send ACHs?\nOr you want to partner with a bank in general? I have a few banks i could list....', 'Just send ACH credits', 'Also interested in this . Pls share list.', 'VISA has a new program that will allow you to start from scratch (no existing business) and issue instant ACH from an account to any card for about $0.35. Worth a look if all you want is ACH movement.\nAs for banks - take a look at synctera. They will hold your hand and intro you to banks and handle all the API and ledger stuff.\nLineage Bank.\nFirst Internet Bank']"
