"[""I'd start with BaFin:\n\nhttps://www.bafin.de/EN/RechtRegelungen/recht\\_regelungen\\_node\\_en.html\n\nAnd then check the terms of use for each of the existing german fintechs – https://www.awesomefintech.com/country/germany/"", 'In EU in general there is law for payment offering', 'Are you asking can you practice fintech law as an attorney or does the actual law exist?\n\nEither way yes. \n\nGeneral banking/financial regulation applies. Any EU specifics like EBA and GDPR. The universe is pretty large and depends what you’re actually doing.', 'Thank you!\r  \nIf I started my search on BaFin haha']"
