"['Spoiler: IBM OS/2', ""Beep boop, I'm [a bot](https://github.com/mlda065/paragraphiser_bot_aws/tree/amp).\n\nIt looks like you've posted a [Google AMP link](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847).\n[Here is the normal link](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/zmp8gy/the-forgotten-operating-system-that-keeps-the-nyc-subway-system-alive) to the article.\n\nAMP is a proprietary walled garden which [benefits Google](https://www.socpub.com/articles/chris-graham-why-google-amp-threat-open-web-15847) and [hurts everyone else](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/19/open_source_insider_google_amp_bad_bad_bad).\nIt is destroying the open web through anti-competitive violation of standards.\n\nIt is bad for publishers because it forces them to duplicate development effort, and prevents differentiation and customisation.\nIt also allows Google to watch you even after you've left their search results page."", ""I don't get how they could end up with a system like this. By 2003 when MetroCard was phased in we had the contactless Oyster system in London, I can use it on any bus, train, tram or boat and I don't even need to get a card - I can just use my credit/debit card or phone without any kind of set up"", ""/u/radiantcabbage has pointed out the lack of a factual basis for your sneering, so I thought I'd help you out by pointing to the magnetic stripe-based Metcard system introduced in Victoria Australia in 1996, which finally went live in 1998, and only fully replaced the paper card tickets in 2002. Sneer away!"", ""Well fintech in the US moves slow because everyone is out to scrape the bottom of the barrel for profit margin while ignoring the consumer. It's only the last year or two that contactless cards are even being issued in mass by the big banks."", ""the system in question here is circa 1993, implementing a metro card system in OS/2 was actually very forward thinking at the time. *tokens were phased out* by 2003, not the same at all and no one ever implied they were in the article. but I'm sure you chose to interpret it that way for obvious reasons"", ""They began implementing and testing the MetroCard system in the late 80's and early 90's so they were basically stuck up a creek especially with how long the MTA takes to implement anything.\n\nWe were supposed to have been off the MetroCard by 2014 and now it's slated for 2022 at the earliest."", ""But contactless systems allow for more profit. I live entirely cashless now and its certainly numbed the feeling of spending tangible money to the point that I'm probably spending more.\n\nAlso for transport it allows non-registered users to just jump on a bus and tap their debit card - so tourists are probably using public transport more"", ""Short-term in-division profit is often valued over long-term overall profit for the firm especially due to how promotions and bonuses work.  \n\nYou'd need effective coordination between all those internal factions with a skilled CEO to really push a fintech firm forward and really, they have the money to cover the lawsuits for the inevitable privacy breaches due to shit data security.""]"
