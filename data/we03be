Accounting to fintech
2022-08-02 12:44:39
"Hello, im currently a rising senior at Mays Business School. I currently have a 2.55 gpa and relevant accounting experience. 

The big four life doesnâ€™t motivate me. I can easily say I donâ€™t want a CPA so I did some hard thinking to find what fascinates me. Tech. 

Seeing the boom in tech gives me the desire to pursuit a career in this field. Ideally id like to make use of my acc degree and I see fintech being the best fit. 

With a low gpa barrier and no tech/coding skills what are some things I can do now to get into the fintech world? What are skills you recommend I learn to make myself a qualified candidate? 

Thanks"
