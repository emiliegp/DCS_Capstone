What does a fintech startup need ?

"I’m organizing a fintech competition in which several fintech startups compete for having developed the most useful tool of the industry. 
The winner will receive a price. -> What is something physical that could be useful for a start up in this industry ? :) 
Only the first place will be awarded. 
Any suggestions are welcome"
"[""If you're the organizer then I'm not gonna do your job for you lol"", ""A book about the history and the landscape of fintech would be interesting to me. If that doesn't exist and you had the bandwidth, creating it would mean a lot. A cheatsheet with a reminder of industry terms like KYC could also be helpful.\n\nMy other suggestion is not tailored for fintech but we all need coffee with the amount of hours invested, so like a productivity kit with a manual espresso machine, quality mug and maybe those plates you put under glasses to make sure they don't stain (I forgot the word) would be great."", '[deleted]', 'First thing they need to do is create a mission/vision letter, and form a compliance team', 'Better winning something useful than a trophy that is just standing around and gets dusty, right ?', 'Nice, cool idea thanks', 'Awesome, I’ll take a look in that field.']"
