Mobile wallet company

"I brought an idea for a mobile wallet startup that uses
qr code and ussd for payments, then I discussed with
my friend who happens to be a software engineer (I'm
also a software engineer as we studied together). Then
we discussed with two more people, one of them a
designer and the other one is just a business owner
and a water resources engineer (not relevant though).
After discussions, we picked a name, reserved a
name for business registration, the designer started
handling branding (logo, cards, posters etc) and we
kept discussing the product and also researching.
My question is what next? After making the app and
website, after business registration and licenses, what
next? They all look at me as the leader since I founded
the idea, how do we assign roles? Do I assign executive
roles to each of us? How do we assign stakes or
equity? I recently finished the business plan and Non
Disclosure Agreements which we're all to sign.
What are the next steps? What do I do? I've no idea and
I want this to work as there's little competition in our
state."
