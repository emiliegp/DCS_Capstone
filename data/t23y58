"Would you spend more of your time building a differentiated product, or more time acquiring users?

I have clear opinions on this; however, I thought I'd gain other insights and opinions from others in the industry."
"['Yes', ""Your valuation and selling price come from users. \n\nBut a good product sure helps get users. Also putting the word 'crypto' on it."", ""They kind of go hand in hand but it depends on your objectives. If you'd be interested in discussing further with an analyst firm, I can help arrange that. Just PM me."", 'You should spend more time acquiring users always', 'Distribution > product. Always.', ""Also came here to provide this exact answer. But slightly less facetiously: The one mistake less experienced startups make most often, is to underestimate the importance of distribution. So if you have to ask this question, chances are that you aren't yet spending enough energy on marketing, partnerships and acquisition.  \n\nOf course there is a corollary: The one mistake established incumbent players make is relying too much on the comfort of their already acquired customers and distribution reach... and not enough on staying competitive with a good enough product. And when that gap eventually grows too big, that's when you get disruption."", 'Crypto is a good way to attract the crowds.', 'Sounds good, thanks.', 'Great answer. Thanks for providing so much detail.', 'I’ll add one more extension to this — just because an incumbent has poor features that you can replicate at a substantially lower price, don’t think that you can compete with them on price.  The price points are high in this space because user acquisition costs a fortune.']"
