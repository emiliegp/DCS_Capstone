Fixing Mortgage for Self Employed Folks
2022-01-25 09:52:18
"I started building a mortgage solution for self-employed, entrepreneurs and small business owners. I wanted to share it in this community to get your thoughts on it and see if anyone has experience building in the lending space.   


**Some background on this whole thing and how I came about to this problem:**  
In 2020, I started working at a bank in ops/data eng. Lot of operational work with a ton of room for improvements. I didn't fit well into the culture. I'm more of a ""see a problem, dive in and let's fix it"" type of person. Banking is heavily regulated and I just kept on running into a wall.

I did that for over a year and left to start consulting. Landed my first client in financial services. I could finally do the ops projects I wanted to do and get paid for it! I learned a lot from this experience, it was a startup scaling and growing at a fast pace so jumping in and helping them build systems and processes was a blast.

**The spark**

Come January 2022, I'm on twitter and scrolling down as I usually do and I come across this tweet about how getting a mortgage as an entrepreneur is a terrible process. What surprised me was that there were hundreds of other entrepreneurs, contractors and small business owners on the same thread sharing the terrible experience they went through just trying to get a mortgage.

I thought this was a joke. How are the people I look up to not able to get a mortgage or go through this painstaking process of buying a home. It just didn't make any sense to me. I went on Reddit and found a few subreddits where I could ask if others also felt this pain. I needed to make sure this wasn't some twitter echo chamber type of frustration. Lo and behold, folks on reddit are also complaining...

So then I went down this rabbit hole of figuring out the mortgage industry. I started calling up lenders, brokers, and banks. Listening to all these niche podcasts about mortgage...exciting I know haha.

After asking for recommendations and calling up brokers, vetting them to understand how they think about their clients and their track record in helping self employed folks. I finally got down to two people that I could rely on to help me with this.

**Launching my MVP.**

What you see on the [website](https://www.duhfinancial.com/) currently is an MVP. It's simple. You fill out the form and I connect you with a lender based on where you live and what you're looking to do.

**Here's what I'm going to be doing in the next few months (feel free to critique this):**

**SEO/Blog Posts**  
There is a layer of education that is missing for the consumer. Often they feel as if they are losing someway/somehow. Demystifying the 'Mortgage for Self Employed' topic can help fix this. I think if I can capture the search traffic and give folks the information they need to remove any barrier towards owning a home that would be a HUGE win.

I'm not a great writer. I'm going to be outsourcing this part of the biz. I reached out to writers who have already written blogs in the mortgage space for credible organizations and will be working with a writer who can help.

**Building relationships with agents**  
I'm aware there are regulations that prevent agents from benefiting financially by asking their client to go to a certain lender. However, in the case that their client is self employed and in need of a mortgage, we can connect them to a lender who can get the client a mortgage and actually close on time, which improves the customer experience which comes back on the agent.

I plan on launching a cold email campaign. I'm thinking giving the agents some sort of '1 Pager' that they can share with their self employed clients would be a win-win. Perhaps even do a webinar but not sure if agents are going to be up for that. They need leads more than a webinar about mortgages.

**Conclusion**

These are my two growth levers that I've confirmed on however I do think there's room for more ways to grow. One step at a time.

There is a lot of room for disruption in this industry. IMO it's important to have a human guide you through the process of getting a loan but all the operational work could definitely be automated if not improved with the right tech.

I could ramble on this for a while...  


We are super early on this journey and just getting started. There are 16 million self employed people in this country, doing this right could really have a meaningful impact.   


What are some initial thoughts you have? 

*P.S Any entrepreneurs in here who have also gone down the process of buying a home and felt this frustration too?*"
"[""Coming from a mortgage broker - What exactly are you looking to do? If self employed people reached out to a knowledgeable mortgage broker that broker would know bank statement loans can be better for this situation, the problem is since it's not a conforming loan the interest rate and closing costs are higher so they usually try to go conforming. The process only sucks when they claim a lot of deductions on their tax returns, in that scenario they most likely won't qualify."", ""Initial thoughts:\n\nThe underlying problem is the systems in place to qualify the credit worthiness are built around rules (and established practices) that allow a mortgage to be packaged up and sold upstream.  Compound that with an army of mortgage brokers that are focused on quick sales and you end up with brokers that either can't take the time to figure out how to help, or give terrible advice to try and make your square peg go into a round hole.  Brokers are going to be focused on volume, anything that slows them down, they are going to avoid. \n\nYou paint this as a massive problem, but if I'm reading this right, in a just a couple of weeks you've tracked down lenders that can get the loans done. So, why are all these self employed individuals failing to do what you've done? \n\nYou could start your own mortgage brokerage firm to fix this, but as noted, there is a reason mortgage brokers don't spend a lot of time on these. \n\nYou could start a referral business by becoming the center of information on how to get these loans and refering visitors to lenders you know can handle them. \n\nI'm struggling to see the opportunity. \n\nYou mentioned tech - there are defiantly issues with the process behind qualifying borrowers. There is work being done to use deeper data sets in individuals to find other avenues to define credit worthiness.  \n\nLast note - have you looked to see if your target market is historically more likely to default on a statistically significant level?"", ""Interesting! As a newly self-employed freelancer looking to buy a home next year, I'm curious and excited to see how this shakes out! \n\nSo is your game plan to create a service for self employed to obtain mortgages or just provide guidance?"", 'In addition to blog posts, content in the form of guided education wizards with videos/text can be helpful. Similar to how Dwellwell does it, or [better.com](https://better.com).', ""I'm looking to improve the experience of getting a mortgage as a self employed person.   \n\n\nThere are multiple points of inefficiencies in the current process that could be improved upon with a range of very simple tech to some more complicated tech.   \n\n\nThree things in what you're saying that stick out to me based on talking to people across the Industry:  \n• Not all brokers even offer non-qm products so what usually happens is they will take the self employed person for a ride, promise them that they will close etc and then it gets to underwriting and the loan falls apart.   \n\n\n• Brokers have enough deal flow of regular W2 borrowers so they often don't even bother with the self employed person's application, due the nuance of each situation taking longer to process.  \n\n\n• On top of that, they don't work with enough self employed clients to understand the nuance and often take longer to figure out what to do so the person can get the mortgage (i.e endlessly asking for paperwork)   \n\n\nI think almost every broker I speak to, I've got the same reaction which is, This already exists. Which is true, however the experience that most self employed folks have when going to get a mortgage is not one that brings joy to the home buying experience. I think that paired with the operational inefficiencies makes it a problem worth solving."", ""These are some really thoughts haha  \n\n\nWhat you mention about brokers trying to fit a square peg in a round hole is correct. This often leads to poor advice. (ex. deduct less expenses...the tax liability on that could be greater than paying a little bit more monthly from interest). Keep in mind that that interest is tax deductible.   \n\n\nIt's the ability to coach the client, help them see the trade offs and actually spend time to understand the nuance is what I think differentiates a broker that serves self employed folks.   \n\n\nYour right a self employed person could spend a few weeks researching, calling brokers across the country, doing all the vetting that I'm doing to find a broker that can help them in the home buying process however most of these self employed folks are running businesses and have other priorities in life. They want a solution without having to do weeks worth of research. The home buying process is already long so adding the research time on top of that could extend the overall process.   \n\n\nThe way I'm currently approaching this in my MVP is to refer people to brokers who can fulfill the loan. We are also publishing blog posts as well to cover the nuances of this topic in detail. This should build trust and when people are ready to buy their home, we can be a trusted source to help them find a broker who can help.   \n\n\nOnce I have proven that model, I think building out a brokerage is a good idea, paired with tech to manage in house operations and improve customer experience. I might be a bit naive but I think this is the way to eventually go.   \n\n\nI've read some articles and scientific papers around the underwriting process and how they can use a variety of data points to understand credit worthiness however I think it's still in the works. The biggest challenge I read about was making sure the new system would be discriminatory towards certain groups. Considering that the current datasets have some of these things baked into them, it makes it hard to leverage the current data to build a new system. It's an exciting space and lots of interesting work to come forth."", 'Congratulations on becoming a freelancer! I just started freelancing last year as well!   \n\n\nAt the moment, our website will be a trusted place for you and other entrepreneurs to find easy to understand information on how to navigate the mortgage part of the home buying process. If you find yourself ready to proceed and purchase a home, we can connect you with a lender to prequalify you and help you understand your buying power as well as fund your loan.', 'I think most important thing is to educate self employed borrowers how to determine what their usable income is on conforming loans based on their tax returns', 'Agreed, we are publishing blog posts that will cover this soon!', 'What you could do is make some type of calculator that asks them step by step what line X says on their tax returns to get to their usable monthly income. Start basic with ""what do you file, 1120, 1120S, 1099 etc"" then go from there, ""what does line X on Sched X say"" and add back the deductions you can etc. if you like this idea and want some help feel free to PM me.', ""I've been thinking of doing this but haven't got to it yet.
