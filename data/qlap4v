"**Usecase** 

Our company allows people to invest in alternative asset funds.   


The current implementation allows users to send money and invest in funds. Everything is currently a manual process through wire transfers. All transactions are currently sent through wires because wires can be reversed. The goal is to turn this into an in-app process.  


  
**Transaction Behavior**

Each transaction has the following touchpoints in the manual implementation ...   


The user enters the amount. Amounts are $25k minimum with no maximum. We have users who allocate 7 & 8 figure checks.  


The number of transactions is unlimited.  


Simultaneously, the user's information is collected and sent to the fund's administrator who runs KYC & AML checks (no longer than 1 week and as little as an instant verification).  


If the user has a KYC or AML failure the wire is canceled by the fund admin and returned to the user and the process restarts.  


  
The ideal solution would be the following ...  


1. The user connects their bank account with the app
2. When a user decides to invest in a fund on the platform the money is sent to our feeder fund as the fund administrator processes KYC & AML requirements
   1. On AML & KYC success, the money remains in the feeder fund and the feeder fund deploys capital into the fund of interest at the end of a time frame with a 3 to 20 business day buffer.
   2. On failure and without the in-app wallet, the payment is removed from the feeder fund and returned to the user's bank account. 
3. The user has an in-app investing account similar to a brokerage account (not necessary in the 1st implementation). When a user decides to invest in a fund on the platform the money is sent to our feeder fund as the fund administrator processes KYC & AML requirements
   1. On success and with the in-app wallet, money is sent directly from the user's bank account to the feeder fund account. 
   2. On failure and with the in-app wallet, the money is sent to the user's wallet.
   3. Independent of investing in a fund users can have cash sit in an in-app wallet and earn a small amount of interest through our in-house treasury fund.
   4. The company can spin app & wind down feeder fund bank accounts on demand 

  
**Current Vendors** 

So far I have looked at Sila Money, SynapseFi, & Dwolla. My past experience with Dwolla was unpleasant and that's putting it mildly.   


My list of vendors to vet includes the following ... 

* Galileo, 
* Marqeta, 
* Cambr, 
* Hydrogen, 
* BBVA, 
* CorePro, 
* Productfy, 
* Treasury Prime

  
Any recommendations or customer reviews would be great. Thanks in advance."
