Best way to lean launch Fintech app?
2022-04-14 08:46:04
I was thinking of just making a simple landing page about my app idea with a basic subscribe option to test the market and see how many people would even be interested.   Any tips on better ideas for a lean launch?
"['If you’re not interested in building an MVP and solely focused on testing the market, a quick landing page with an email waitlist sign up is a solid approach. I’d also recommend running a low budget ad campaign on fb with your target demo to get a very rough sense for CAC (obvi there will be drop off in-app as part of onboarding but gives you some top of funnel acquisition data).', 'Lean landing page describing the product with a waitlist and ideally a quick survey asking some key questions. Who is the user, what they struggle with, how many hours a day spent doing X, etc. Would then follow up with detailed interviews and only then design and build the product. Would leave out subscription until you’ve formulated the proposition, you can get commits from people during the interview. It’s a longer process but the results will be at least 10x. Good luck!', 'thank you']"
