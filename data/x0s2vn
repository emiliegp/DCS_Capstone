Looking for Fintech API that shows credit card points

"I'm looking for any fintech APIs that provide the ability to read how many points you have on your credit cards. I tried looking at the docs for Plaid, Yodlee, MX but none of them seem to have this information. 

Is there any known API that is able to access this information? If not, how do I build my own?"
"['You can try to contact/email the dev teams that work on the API directly. They may be willing to work with you if you can convince them how it would be beneficial to them. \n\nOtherwise build a bot scraper that navigates the site with selenium or a similar tool and fetches the points data.', ""Points data is not a consumer's data to share, thus, you will have to scrape this information if you are not inferring it by learning about the program.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNone of the aggregators provide this information because consumers don't own it.  The banks and credit card companies do and thats why it isnt shared via any established APIs"", 'Better off asking your users to put it in tbh', 'This is the best answer', 'Thanks u/thoughtbot_1, do you know what scrapping tool could I use for this?', ""That isn't dynamic though. I want my app to keep updating their current points which can be done if there is some sort of connection established."", 'I would recommend finding someone who focuses on this and building the integrations in-house.  Banks will have better security than most web scraping tools can accommodate. From a risk perspective, you are making a conscious decision to build and try to access something that they are going to actively block you if your scale your business.']"
