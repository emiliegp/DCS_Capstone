Fintech regulations in Canada

"Working on a fintech app for **businesses**. Having some trouble finding resources on the regulations surrounding this. What information can/should I be collecting on these companies? Address, articles of inc., founders/shareholder details (citizenship, status, veteran status, etc.), etc.? Are any of those necessary? Any leads on these types of regulations would help me out a lot! Completely lost on this. Thanks!"
"['Open a business account with Wise to see what they’re asking for, and ask the same questions on your app.', 'Are you serious about building this FinTech app? If so.. it doesn’t matter what you want the user experience to look like. You will need to use the compliance rules of your banking partner who might be different from Wise’s. \n\nWho is your banking partner?', 'Come join our discord group and we can exchange on the topic \n\nI’m starting a discord channel for all fintech founders. \n\nhttps://discord.gg/WAzmZpY5', 'https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/financial-sector-policy/open-banking-implementation/terms-of-reference.html', 'Fintech regulation is a real challenge for business owners in any country. We still have a lot of work to do in this direction. As for Canada, there is no single regulatory body, it all depends on the type of service you provide. As far as I know, the activities of banks and loan companies in Canada are subject to regulation by Minister of Finance of Canada (Finance Minister), Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), Bank of Canada (BoC), Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee (FISC).\n\nSo, search depending on the type of service you provide.']"
