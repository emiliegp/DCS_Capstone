Neobanks are going public in droves...here's a brief who's who for fellow fintechers

"Neobanks, or digital-only banks, aren’t saddled by traditional banking technology and costly networks of physical branches. Instead, all of their banking services are conducted completely online via desktop or mobile app.   The concept of neobanks has gained serious traction in recent years, catalyzed by the imposition of the ""pandemic economy"" of closed offices and remote working.  Meanwhile, to date venture capital is flowing to neobanks. At the end of 2020, there were 256 neobanks worldwide, according to Exton Consulting.    In Q3 2021, one in every three newly minted unicorn startups was a fintech company. And forty-six fintechs have gone public in 2021, compared with 31 for all of 2020. 

The rise of neobanks will be largely supported by the growing demand for digital banking services from younger consumers, as well as increasing trust of digital-only banks by consumers of all ages. The US has one of the highest numbers of digital-only bank account holders at 23.1 million. It is poised to retain this growth due to the country’s massive population and ability to boast some of the world’s oldest digital-only banks.  Overall, there will be 47.5 million digital-only bank account holders in the US by 2024, increasing at a 19.8% CAGR from 2020, and US digital-only banks’ penetration will increase by 8.9 percentage points between 2020 and 2024.

Now onto some of three of the big names to be aware of:

**Nubank**, which plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange, is the biggest neobank. It has more than 48 million customers in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Nubank posted a $99 million loss for the nine months ended in September.   Nubank is hoping to raise some $3 billion in its IPO, for a total valuation of more than $50 billion, which would make it Latin America's biggest bank, surpassing traditional Brazilian bank Itau Unibanco.  They've recently filed the paperwork for their IPO, and should be listing on NYSE imminently.

**Chime Bank** is in talks to go public at a valuation of $35 to $45 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, and it’s targeting March of 2022 for the IPO. The company’s revenue will likely reach $900 million to $1 billion this year, the person said.  At a valuation of $35 billion-plus, Chime would be more valuable than regional banks like Fifth Third, M&T and Regions, each of which has hundreds of branches and brought in more than $1 billion in net profit in 2020. Chime has not been consistently profitable, although CEO Chris Britt has said the company turned a net profit in the second quarter of 2020.  

**Aspiration is** led by CEO Andrei Cherny, and its main distinguisher from others in the field is to tackle climate change through its services. The fintech has pledged to its 53 million members that savings and debit card purchases will never be used to fund big-carbon polluters such as the oil or coal industries.  In this way, Aspiration is brining a unique ESG focus to the broader fintech space, which is much need given the current global emphasis on getting more serious about meeting net zero commitments.  In August 2021, Aspiration announced a merger with Interprivate III Financial Partners Inc., a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), which will see it listed on the New York Stock Exchange with a projected initial valuation of $2.3 billion, perhaps as soon as the end of this year. 

In my view, this wave of neobanking IPOs fits into the broader trend of finTech's explosive growth in recent years that only seems to be accelerating rather than slowing down.  What we are witnessing is a gradual maturation of a relatively new industry, evidenced by the transition from private to public financing. In consequence, consumers will likely be the prime beneficiaries.  Stricter regulatory compliance with the US financial system, augmented transparency, and access a much more significant pool of capital means that neobanks can provide a better more secure service to customers for a better price."
"['It’s worth remembering that the new bank sector is getting very crowded. Margins are being squeezed. It’s not realistic to expect them to make as much money as the legacy banks did, as they don’t charge the big fees they did/do.\n\nI’m a big fan of neobanks, the lack of branch network is a huge advantage, but it’s not all roses!', 'SoFi has entered the chat.', ""Great breakdown!\n\nHere're 200+ neobanks – [https://www.awesomefintech.com/category/challenger-banks/](https://www.awesomefintech.com/category/challenger-banks/) \n\nAlso worth mentioning recent news about N26 exiting the US market. So we will see domestic neobanks strengthening their positions further and further."", ""I made the neo bank switch to Aspiration because of their amazing reforestation and climate action against big issues like fossil fuels. I love that I can track my carbon footprint on the app as well. All around great bank and so much easier than the traditional big bank system 100%. Don't always believe the hype. I know it's super hard to believe that not everyone is greenwashing, but I can honestly say from experience that Aspiration actually cares for the climate."", 'Respectfully disagree.\nThere will be 1K more successful neobanks displacing 12K one-size-fits-nobody traditional banks and CUs.\n\nIf you look at the currently successful neobanks, they are way too broad: \nOne is just a  ""neobank that does not suck"", the other is a ""slightly better looking mobile banking app"", the third is just ""the same mobile banking but focused on savings"", etc.\nAt first all neobanks had to do is just to exist and offer the very basics, then others followed and needed to just offer a better UI. Now we are witnessing a new wave of those who actually solve very specific, unmet demand.\n\nThere will be many more neobanks which will focus on segments who\'s needs are underserved.\n\nIt is hard to convince people to change banks, but there are new customers to the market every day.\nSome are obsessed with climate change. If all else is equal, they will go to Atmos or Aspiration; gay people opening their first bank account may prefer Daylight et al; Dominican migrants with Spanish as their first language will prefer Spanish-speaking neobank if all else is equal.\n\nSlowly, gradually, inevitably segment-specific neobanks will displace banks which serve no one in particular.', 'SoFi not mentioned here, but Chime is? SoFi is beating Chime in sales at over $1B and owns Galileo, with 89 million users, and runs the payment processing for 90% of all fintechs.\n\nI can’t read this without SoFi technologies being mentioned with seriousness.', ""Good point and I 100% agree we'll be witnessing some serious market consolidation over the course of the present decade due to slimmer profit margins/M&A/current saturation.  Those that are able to distinguish themselves from more generic competitors, like say Aspiration with its ESG focus, are more likely to succeed IMO but we'll see..."", 'u/Wombleshart sorry kind of new to this concept of neobanks. What is holding off the displacement/disruption of the larger banks like BoA, Wells Fargo, Key Bank, etc.? What are neobanks missing?', 'You might want to read the Prorepublica article on them.', 'Are you affiliated with them in any way?', 'I always welcome debate, and always like to hear an alternative view. It is/was hard to convince people to change banks. That’s changing rapidly. Millennials aren’t as fooled by suits and stone shop fronts as people have traditionally been. I do agree that niche banks will the way.', 'There is so much legacy banking infrastructure in place. Payments, custody, settlement, and then the reporting systems to the regulators etc. This is being replaced and improved, but it will be a long process. Like switching from fossil fuels to renewable, there will be big “transition” plays, onboarding the old world with the new. It’s long overdue and I agree, the winners will win big.', 'agreed. a lot of them are struggling to find a path to a profitable model. In addition some have been way too agressiv in their expansion ( look at N26 pulling out of north america) for example', 'The disruption is real, neobanks will replace the old ones. However, they won’t make the margins legacy banks made, all be it without much legacy cost eg branch network.', ""I have and tbh I have my reservations about it, but to each their own really. You might want to read their CEO's [response](https://twitter.com/AndreiCherny/status/1461007567128199171?s=20) if you haven't, just to keep things more balanced."", ""Wouldn't the lack of branch network be a weakness? And the lower margins are due to lower fees right? \n\nAlso, why have so many of these neobanks not been able to get a banking license?"", 'Branch networks are hugely expensive and no longer require due to tech. Cash is on its way out. Yes, lower margins because they have no fees. I believe many neobanks have a crypto element that regulators are unhappy with.', ""I think SoFi and Starling Bank are probably the closest to becoming fully fledged banks (possibly Revolut I'm not sure).""]"
