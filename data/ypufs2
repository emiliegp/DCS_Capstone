Question - most appropriate refinancing structures for fintech that factors receivables
2022-11-09 05:29:48
"I run a fintech that factors receivables and I need a lender (financial institution) that will refinance my portfolio. What is the most appropriate type of facility that I should be seeking? Given the short term nature of my product (receivables that pay back during 90 days), I would think that the most appropriate refinancing facility for me would be a **revolving** line of credit. Basically my fintech taps into it whenever I (or my SPV) buys a receivable and pay it down whenever that receivable is settled by a debtor. To anyone who works in that space, does the above sound right? Do financial institutions actually provide **revolving** lines of credit to fintechs to fund their issuance? I will be very grateful to hear from anyone who has experience in that niche.

p.s. can anyone comment, to the extent the above types of facilities are offered, what is their average tenor (i.e. when do they wind down)? "
"['I work for a financial institution, and yes institutional investors can provide you with a debt facility that acts as a revolving credit line as long as the receivables meet their eligibility criteria set in a term sheet that is agreed by both parties (I.e you and the institutional investor). From my experience, an average facility tenor would probably be 24 months.']"
