"There's so much hype around Open Banking these days, like people wetting their pants about what a huge opportunity this is and what a big part of the fintech/banking/finance economy it's going to be.

Can someone explain the hype to me please. Am I dumb? Isn't it just a bunch of APIs?"
"['Yea but put an NFT on that OpenBanking and BOOM!', 'A Dumb Bank is serving everyone with one-size-fits-nobody products.\nYou find a segment which is clearly underserved. Say, long-haul truckdrivers or any other segment with distinct self-identification, slightly different income structure or having strong bias towards certain idea.\nYou build a banking service for them: an app which talks in their language, built to their aesthetics, includes certain lending products specific to them, has fees/limits tuned to their needs.\n\nIf you do it right you have a way of stealing customers from Dumb Bank, but not other way around.\n\nIf Dumb Bank pays $800 to acquire a new customer and you pay $5, if Dumb Bank has not grown since 50es and your customer base is doubling each year, if customers are indifferent about DB and love your brand, it is easy to justify $2k/customer valuation.\n\nOpen Banking is a set of APIs which enable this kind of scenarios. The hype is well-justified.', 'It is, but banks in EU are required to provide access to *your* data via this api. \n\nBefore the openbanking you had to scrape it yourself. Pretty much what Plaid is doing in the US.', 'Yes, a bunch of APIs', 'Wait until they grow big enough and are subject to additional compliance requirements. Itâ€™s easy to grow to a certain point, then the regulations kick in.', 'It is a bunch of APIs, however the experiences you build with them around seamlessly paying people, receiving money, whatever you can dream of legally doing with their data are what makes them come alive.\n\nSource: work for a listed company using open banking.', ""I presume that this hype is all about making transactions and customer experience more seamless. Nowadays, big fintech players are betting on integrated payments, implying that APIs are what may prove helpful in this undertaking. In any event, [open banking](http://dashdevs.com/blog/psd2-and-open-banking-bring-about-new-security-threats-how-to-prevent-them/?utm_source=article&utm_medium=reddit&utm_campaign=psd2_and_open_banking) is a trending phenomenon because it'll undoubtedly bring about more benefits to both users and service providers. It's a tough and time-consuming process, after all. So we need to wait for more breakthrough technologies to upheave the industry, thereby making open banking more transparent."", 'Exactly what i thought :P', ""TAB bank did exactly that for long-haul truckdrivers!
