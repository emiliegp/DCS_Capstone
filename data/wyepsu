"Credit Shifu mentioning a Fin Tech called ""Save"" where he says you can get FDIC insurance on principal while still getting exposure to stock market, I don't understand, can you help me find someone smarter than me to evaluate this? Wary of this, too good to be true"

you may want to consider

**the company save if you want the chance**

of earning a much higher interest rate

with the small amount of risk that you

may earn no interest at all they

describe themselves as banking with

market returns since your deposits are

fdic insured up to 250 000 like other

banks but you earn interest at a rate

linked to the stock and bond markets you

can earn an average return of 4.45 if

you keep your money in the account for a

year as of july 2022. now if the stock

market goes down it could affect the apy

that you receive however unlike

investing in stocks directly it will not

affect the value of the capital that you

have deposited into the account it only

affects the apy and if the stock market

does well you could earn more than 4.45

percent also the longer you leave the

money in there the higher the expected

return will be for a two-year term it is

5.84 and for a five-year term the

estimated annual return is nine point

four four percent per year so this is a

great option at a time when although

bank interest rates have gone up it's

still only around two percent so it's

nowhere near even beating inflation let

alone earning some money but with save

you do have the possibility of earning a

lot more with the very small possibility

that you might earn less or nothing but

when the competition is only two percent

you're not really losing much if the

stock market does go down and you lose

all your interest in your save account

since the competition was only two

percent anyway how much is that even

going to be on ten thousand dollars

that's only 200 bucks that you would

earn in interest and you do have the

My big concern is this: yes sure, his argument is something like this ""why not do this, worst case scenario you just miss out on 2% if the market crashes but your principal is proteted""

But my concerns are:

\- But like is our principal really guaranteed? If they could just do this scheme, then why aren't other companies or banks doing it?

\- There are alternatives like 5 year TIPS which don't participate in the market but should do well if there is unexpected inflation

\- it seems too good to be true, why would they give us like 4% APY with no risk on our principal? There must be some kind of risk to our principal that they aren't saying

&#x200B;

If they lose alot of money in the stock market, what would happen? "
