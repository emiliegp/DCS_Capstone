Is ethical banking important to you?

"Hello!

Do you think all banks should go green? What's your general opinion on [ethical banking](http://dashdevs.com/blog/ethical-banking-characteristics-and-impact-on-the-achievement-of-business-goals-1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=article)? Would you invest in a bank that, say, is funding fossil fuels?"
"['(Re)Read Ben Elton\'s ""Stark"", a novel written in the 1980s. Nope, it\'s not a fintech (obv.!) book, nor a financial book, ... but a comedy novel set around the premise that the (ultra) wealthy of the world conspire and agree to carry on making money as priority number 1, 2 and 3 even though they know perfectly well that their cumulative actions (fossil fuels, extractive industries, paying minimum wage, etc., etc.) are not only ruining the earth but destroying it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, to answer your question, even though I consider myself a green libtard left-ist, yes, I would make money where I can, and I would (and do) invest in fossil fuels.  Mainly because if someone is going to make money out of it, it might as well be me.  That said, I fully support government oversight to ""do the right thing"", to be ""the adult in the room"", and phase in carbon tax (as an example) or fuel tax (as another) that would make fossil fuels less attractive as an investment while also raising a penny for the nation\'s coffers. I.e. ""polluter pays"".  This obviously isn\'t going to happen, ever, anywhere.  Just as big tobacco wouldn\'t allow the end of cigarettes, big oil, nor big ag., nor big Pharma are going to allow the end of fossil fuels.  If/as/when fossil fuels begins to not be a good investment -- ""polluter pays"" disincentives introduced, or removal of govt. subsidies, etc. -- I\'d invest elsewhere.', ""It's important to me. I prefer companies that are green over those that don't even try."", 'I have a preference on supporting green companies.  But it leaves a bad taste in my mouth when companies equate green with ethical, and even worst labeling their competitors as “unethical” because they’re not doing the same.  For that reason, i’d not be investing in these self righteous companies.', 'Generally: yes, banks and other institutional investors have a huge responsibility.   \nBut it is not trivial to determine which companies or banks are actually ""green"" or ""ethical"" because there is no established standard for that. At the end of the day, we have to trust the impact assessment by analysts. I tweeted about the search for the best way to invest in the green transition [here](https://twitter.com/echo_impact/status/1471169195962511364?s=20).  \n\n\nDisclaimer: I am part of a fintech startup ([echo-exchange.com](https://echo-exchange.com)) that has come up with a market-based approach (information allocation via trading of company-specific impact certificates) to solve this issue.', 'If green investments were more attractive - would you go for them?', ""So you'd never invest in, say, fossil fuel, even on very beneficial terms?"", 'If they were equally attractive or more attractive then yes, I would.\n\nWith the advantage of 20/20 hindsight, what solar or wind or other green investment could I have invested in 10 or 20 years ago that would have equalled or bettered the market?', 'Probably not. There are a lot of places to invest.', ""Well, it's fair about the way it was years ago. But what about the present?""]"
