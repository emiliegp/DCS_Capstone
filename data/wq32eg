Looking to switch careers
2022-08-17 05:22:30
"I’m a regular Amazon Employee looking to change my career into Fintech. I live in Charlotte, NC which is a well known big bank city. There’s a course I completed yesterday about “Financial Technology (Fintech) Innovations Specialization” by Coursera-University of Michigan. I don’t have anything else as far as associates or bachelors degree. I worked previously in Wells Fargo as a Bilingual teller but only lasted 4-5 months. I decided to take advantage of the tuition reimbursement of my job to do a Fintech Bootcamp with UNC Charlotte. My expectations are low now that I’ve read mixed reviews about bootcamps. Any recommendations on what to do so I can improve? Or ideas?"
"['This is what is included into the program: \n\nModule 1: Intro to FinTech\nGain a baseline understanding of things like financial modeling and financial statement analysis.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\nFintech landscape Time-series analysis Financial ratios\nModule 2: Financial Programming\nLearn how to use Python and APIs to run robust financial analyses and build applications that rely on real-time data.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\nPython\nFinancial modeling\nPandas\nMatplotlib\nStatistical programming\nAPIs\nSQL\nNumPy\nSciPy\nPyViz\nModule 3: Machine Learning Applications in Finance\nLearn to use machine learning techniques to predict future outcomes, determine credit worthiness, buy and sell stocks, and more.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\nAlgorithmic trading\nRandom forests\nK-nearest neighbors\nSupport vector machines\nScikit-learn\nLinear regression\nLogistic regression\nK-means clustering\nNeural networks\nForecasting\nAmazon Web Services\nModule 4: Blockchain and Cryptocurrency\nDevelop a technical understanding of how blockchains work, and learn to use Solidity, the most popular blockchain language.\n\nWhat you will learn:\n\nSolidity\nSmart contracts\nConsensus algorithms\nTransactions\nValidation\nDistributed ledger\nEthereum\nCryptocurrency\nMining\nTruffle suite\nGanache', 'I’d suggest trying to narrow your search to more specific disciplines within fintech and work backwards from there to enhance your resume. The courses/training I’d suggest for an aspiring engineer would be considerably different compared to someone looking to get into sales, product, operations, etc. \n\nFor me, the boot camp you mentioned would be a nice bonus to see when reviewing your resume, but I probably wouldn’t expect it to give you a ton of practical knowledge that you’d be applying in an entry level role. That can be different for engineering bootcamps that can give people a decent enough foundation to get their foot in the door given the high demand for engineers in the space.']"
