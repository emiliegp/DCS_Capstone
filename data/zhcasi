KYC/KYB tool?
2022-12-10 10:27:08
"Hey all, I am trying to use a KYC/KYB tool for an accounts payable product we are launching. We are using TreasuryPrime to do our BaaS. Seems like TreasuryPrime uses Alloy under the hood but building the onboarding form seems like a lot of work with a lot of edge cases with Non US citizens(lots of cross border canadian freight), doc collection, appeals, manual review etc.   


Space is really crowded but there were a couple that caught me eye and wanted to see if people had recommendations on which one to use:   


1. [Persona](https://withpersona.com):
   1. Pros:
      1. Seems easy to use
      2. Client SDK
      3. Fraud mitigation
   2. Cons:
      1. Does not connect to TreasuryPrime
2. [Cascade](https://joincascade.io):
   1. Pros:
      1. Client SDK
      2. Can integrate with our BaaS provider
      3. Fast integration
      4. Cheap
   2. Cons:
      1. New company?
      2. Not sure how good is fraud mitigation?

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any other recommendations? TIA"
"['Try cognito', 'Check Acuant and Fraud.net', 'Second cognito', 'Socure.', ""I'd recommend Cascade. They make it super easy to iterate on your KYC flows (like reordering data-collection screens) which allows you to have the most conversion.""]"
