"Hi,

for our product we use the a card's IIN to figure out the card's origin and local currency. we've been paying for exactbins DB dumps for the last few years. their pricing has gone up quite a bit and I was wondering if there are alternatives around.

ideally it's a provider that offers a dump of IINs we can import into our software. APIs would probably add too much overhead to our request handling.

any recommendations? thanks"
