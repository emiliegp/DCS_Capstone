"Hi guys! I am struggling with my master's thesis topic. It is supposed to be about fintech regulations. I was thinking about fintechs connected to banking becasue it is the most developed one but idk if it is good idea. Maybe blockchain, crypto-assets would be better? I also struggle with how the topic should sound? Does anyone have some ideas in which path would be the best to take? I am not asking you for giving me the whole topic for my thesis just some advice since I am new to it."
"['Almost every company in fintech is based on a regulation of some sort - either making it less painful for those effected by it or enabled by the changing of some regulation. For my company (wealth management) it’s FINRA and SEC regulations.  For banking, it’s OCC, MTL, AML, and Dodd Frank regulations.  There’s loads of info on the respective govt agencies websites.', 'The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis did a series of papers on fintech regulation. If you go to its website and search for ""supervising financial institutions"" there are a number of blogs/posts that contain good info as well as links to additional info.\n\nOne of the challenges of working in this area is that there is an enormous patchwork of regulations. As u/ResistantOlive noted earlier, there are a number of Federal entities with supervisory powers. But there are also state regulations (California\'s Consumer Privacy Act springs to mind) and state regulators. Even the European Union has regs that apply to American companies like Google and FaceBook.\n\nMaybe your paper should discuss what a regulatory minefield fintechs must operate in.  :D\n\nGood luck!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited to correct spelling', ""This is very interesting and cheering you on with this research!!!!  \nYour approach looks to be more focused on the 'security' or product based regulations.  Im equally new to this and taking it from a Canadian perspective I think about it by looking at the regulators and focus on what they look for, their scope of authority and what/ how they regulate. \n\nWith this approach (and very much welcome the feedback!!), I look at Financial Industry regulations of which there are plenty and Technology based regulations more focused on privacy, data and information. Also something that may be of value to consider is RegTech which is technology based regulation as a solution to the massive task of regulation utilizing big data."", ""I would start with the OCC website and read the recent press releases. They're all relevant to your topic. \n\nhttps://www.occ.gov/"", 'Great to see you diving in. It\'s a space that needs more attention by interested people.\n\nStart with a framework of what you\'re trying to analyze before you go too deep. Fintech isn\'t a ""thing."" It is technology that powers business activities. Those activities are subject to different regulations authored & enforced by different regulators depending on the activity. \n\n[Who Regulates Whom?](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44918.pdf) is as good a summary as you\'ll find.\n\nFrom there I\'d recommend looking for papers that find the gaps between regulated papers. [Dan Awrey\'s Bad Money](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3532681) is one such example. He identifies a gap where ""institutions seeking to issue monetary liabilities"" aren\'t subject to the same safety and soundness standards as banks, yet they\'re growing quite quickly. The purpose of the paper is to propose a solution, but you\'ll get a lot out of the first half where he details problem.\n\nA fair warning: this is drinking from the firehose. It gets easier once you narrow into specific domains. Almost no one - certainly not me - has depth across all of fintech.\n\nContext - I\'ve built a fintech company, built in the blockchain and crypto spaces, previously built & sold tech to banks globally for managing regulatory compliance and managing know your customer obligations. While I\'ve worked globally, my comments here are US focused.', 'Also, found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/husufd/fintech_regulations/) searching through the sub, might be helpful']"
