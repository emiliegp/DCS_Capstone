"The following guide explains several factors contributing to the success and inherent value of merging art with NFT and blockchain technology: [NFTs Ignite The Digital Art Scene](https://www.oobit.com/blog/nfts-ignite-the-digital-art-scene/)

* Saleability

Through the use of NFTs, artists are able to access markets that were otherwise controlled by centralized organisations. Content creators now have a global platform that can be accessed from anywhere by anyone.

* Verifiable Ownership

Taking a giant leap forward in terms of ownership in the traditional art world, NFTs hold all ownership history in public records. Through the use of blockchain technology, anyone can access the ownership rights of an NFT, also making it possible to verify the artwork’s authenticity.

* Immutability

As mentioned earlier, no one can tamper with data on a blockchain, once it is recorded it cannot be edited or changed.

* Royalties

When an artist creates an NFT they can include a clause in the code to ensure that each time it changes hands they receive a portion of the sale money. Decentralizing resale royalties puts the power back into the creators’ hands."
