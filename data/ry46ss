"Amid the crackdown on crypto mining launched by the Chinese government in May, Kazakhstan became a magnet for companies involved in the minting of digital currencies, thanks to its capped electricity rates and generally positive attitude towards the industry. 

The countryâ€™s average monthly hashrate share exceeded 18% last year, with the Central Asian country turning into a major mining hotspot.

Thousands of Kazakhstanis took to the streets this week to express their anger over the socioeconomic conditions in their country after the government removed a cap on prices of natural gas and other fuels. 

Kazakhstan has been largely offline in the past couple of days, with disruptions affecting phone connections as well. The monitoring group Netblocks revealed on Wednesday that the country is in an internet blackout.

The rapidly developing events in Kazakhstan affected cryptocurrency markets and the price of bitcoin (BTC) fell below the $44K mark on Wednesday when the crypto economy shrank by around 4.5% to $2.25 trillion, as Bitcoin.com News reported. The cryptocurrency with the largest market capitalization is trading under $43,000 per coin at the time of writing on Thursday.

Members of the crypto community have expressed fears that a further deterioration of the situation in Kazakhstan could affect the indicator even more as miners may begin to relocate to jurisdictions with a more stable political environment and power supply."
