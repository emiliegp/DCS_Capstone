Real-time account data for over 90 million accounts at major brokerages
2022-03-29 02:58:46
"Hey r/fintech! Our [API](https://www.realizefi.com/) now supports over 90 million accounts at the top brokerages in the US. We differ from Plaid and others because we pull data in real-time (rather than every 12 hours), pull 15 years worth of data (rather than 6 months), and allow users to send orders to their brokerages.

If you've had issues with investments APIs in the past, we felt your pain... that's why we built this.

Feel free to create an account [here](https://www.realizefi.com/register) and test out the API using our [documentation](https://docs.realizefi.com/reference/overview)."
"['Curious how this works under the hood compared to Plaid', 'Screen scraping?', ""I'll be checking it out.\n\nAny guidance on your rollout - institutional coverage/ roadmap and business model?"", ""cool! (don't forget to link to your job post!)"", 'wen fidelity?', 'Plaid and Yodlee screen scrape in order to provide investing data. (Fun fact: some legacy brokerages have implemented significant countermeasures to screen-scrapers, including blocking suspect user agents and IP addresses, requiring non-headless browsers, presenting subtly different login pages to unfamiliar user agents, bricking links with 2FA, etc.)  \n\n\nWe take an entirely different approach by building direct integrations via public APIs or reverse-engineering, which increases authentication success rates and allows us to produce more accurate, more frequent data.', ""We don't screen scrape"", 'Feel free to email me at [sean@realizefi.com](mailto:sean@realizefi.com) or grab a time [here](https://calendly.com/realizefi) and I can walk you through everything / show you the API in action!', 'Fidelity should be out within the next month.', 'Thanks for the quick reply! Is it free for now while you develop? Or is pricing already available?', ""The product is already fully operational and being integrated into dozens of companies' products! We also add a new major integration every 2 weeks or so. We still need to create a pricing page on our website but I do have a pricing doc that I can send to you - will send you a DM to ask for email."", 'Very interesting product.\n\nWhat brokerages do you support right now ?', 'We support Robinhood, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, E\\*Trade, Webull, Alpaca, with the remaining large brokerages soon to be released after further testing.\n\nFeel free to reach me at [sean@realizefi.com](mailto:sean@realizefi.com) or choose a time [here](https://calendly.com/realizefi) if you want to learn more!']"
