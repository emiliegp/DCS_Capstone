How/when are credit card fees distributed to the players?

"Hi [r/fintech](https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/)!

I am rather confused how and when fees are distributed in the credit card payments process. From what I understand, the major players are the customer, merchant, gateway, payment processor, card network, issuing bank, and acquiring bank. Here are some of the fees I am wondering about (some of them might overlap slightly):

\-Interchange

\-Scheme/assessment

=Processing

\-Acquirer markup

\-Transaction

\-Authorization

\-Gateway fee

1. WHEN in the process are these individual fees paid, and WHO pays them? Is it the acquiring bank once the money is transferred to them? Is it the payment processor? Is it someone else?
2. Are some of these fees paid on a monthly basis? How does this process work?
3. I've heard that some of these fees are charged even if the transaction is ultimately declined (especially to the gateway and processor). It seems as though the acquiring bank pays a lot of these fees to the different players, but if the transaction doesn't go through and the acquiring bank doesn't receive any funds, is the acquiring bank still responsible in paying these fees, or is someone else? Who alerts them that these fees have been accrued?
4. I am confused what the ""acquirer"" is, as sometimes the term seems to refer to ""payment processor"", and sometimes to the ""acquiring bank"". I've heard they can even be the same thing...
5. When there is a funds transfer between banks (ie. from the issuing to the acquiring bank), how are the actual funds transferred? Is there some sort of payment processor that gets paid to actually transfer the funds, or is this all in-house between the issuing bank and the acquiring bank? Is the money wired?

I know I've asked a ton of questions, so any insights into any of these would be TREMENDOUSLY helpful. Thank you in advance for all of your insights!!"
"['The fees are assessed at the moment of the transaction. So eg a $100 transaction.\n\nIssuing bank keeps $2, pays $98 to card scheme\nCard scheme keeps $0.50, pays $97.5 to acquirer\nAcquirer keeps $0.50, pays merchant $97\n\nSome merchants pay their fees monthly, in which case the acquirer will issue an invoice to the merchant for their $0.50\n\nGateway fees etc are also per transaction, charged to the merchant.\n\n\nTo your other point: the funds settlement and financial messaging is what the card scheme does. They receive funds from the issuing banks, net off fees, then make bank transfers to the acquiring bank.', '1.\ttypically funds are settled net of fees to the next player in the value chain, starting with the issuer. At the time of the transaction those funds are held in the account/balance of the card holder by the issuer. Once a transaction is processed, those funds are no longer the customers money, but a debt to be paid by the issuer to the scheme within hours to 1-2 days, less the issuers fee (interchange). The scheme then takes its fees (scheme fees etc) and settles the funds to the acquiring bank and so on. At the end the merchant receives the funds less the fees of all players in the value chain. \n2.\tas above, fees are removed before settling to the next player. In some cases gross settlement is used, and the payment made after the fact. But depending on volumes this becomes very capital intensive very quickly.\n3.\tit depends on the agreements between the players\n4.\tthe acquirer is a bank who distributes the money to the merchants, sometimes with a payments processor or other player in between\n5.\tpayment is via local bank transfer to the scheme, who then have the international presence to settle it to the acquiring banks anywhere in the world. This is key to their offering.', 'Scroll midway down this post to ""how does Visa profit"" for a visual overview of how the fees flow between players:\n\nhttps://blog.bytebytego.com/p/ep19-live-streaming-visa-payment', 'This is so helpful! When and how does the payment processor get paid in this loop from issuing bank to card scheme to acquiring bank?', 'correct', 'Thank you so much for this explanation! When and how does the payment processor get paid in this loop from issuing bank to card scheme to acquiring bank? Furthermore, does the gateway just bill the merchant directly instead of being in this flow from issuing bank to card scheme to acquiring bank?', ""Payment Processor is a slightly woolly term (it is inaccurately used by some people as a synonym for any one of  'acquirer' 'payment facilitator' 'payment service provider', even 'gwteway') but if that PP is involved in the merchant settlement flow, then their fees would be subtracted before merchant is paid (settled). If the PP is outside the merchant settlement flow, they would typically invoice the merchant each month.\n\nI'm not trying to confuse you by introducing more terms - the value chain is becoming more comoditised, with many of the biggest players needing to combine multiple parts into a single offering. Typically that's what a Payment Processor would be - e.g. gateway+acquirer+fraud screening together eg Stripe, Adyen, hence why the PP term doesn't have a single definition."", 'The payment processor likely holds the direct relationship with the merchant, and if they have settlement capabilities (e.g can hold and settle funds to their merchants) then they will deduct their fee after receiving the funds from the acquiring bank, and before settling to the merchant. I’ve also seen the acquiring bank do the settlement on behalf of the processor/service provider, or hold the merchant relationship directly (e.g. Adyen). I don’t think gateways are involved in the settlement, so fees would be paid separately.', 'That makes sense! If the processor is within the merchant settlement flow, would it go issuing bank > card scheme > processor > acquiring bank? Or would the acquiring bank send the funds to the processor once it has received the funds from the card scheme? I know oftentimes the acquiring bank will then wire the funds to the merchant, as the acquiring bank acts as a sponsor bank that is an intermediary.', 'If the processor is within the merchant settlement flow it is probably acting as an acquirer (per my earlier comment, it can mean a lot of things) and so yes, your flow works.', 'You mean issuing bank > card scheme > processor > acquiring bank > merchant? Thanks again for the help- I just want to be crystal clear', 'Yep']"
