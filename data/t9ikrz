"Hey everyone,   
My friend and I built a 'Social Sentiment API' service aimed to help users in this community to identify, follow, and take advantage of trending stocks and cryptocurrencies across Twitter, StockTwits, and Reddit. 

**Sample Data Posted Here:**   
check it out on Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/taipanda9686/real-time-social-sentiment-for-stocks-crypto?select=social\_sentiment\_top50\_trending.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/taipanda9686/real-time-social-sentiment-for-stocks-crypto?select=social_sentiment_top50_trending.csv)

The ‘Sentiment’ API captures data points such as posts, comments, likes, upvotes, and impressions for stocks and cryptocurrencies discussed on these popular social platforms. We think this could be a great resource for you fintech enthusiasts, especially those building analytics and ML pipelines for financial analysis.

"['Question for you, I can see you have put in a lot of effort, but have you accounted for filtering out manipulation/bad actors pumping the stock? Also do you have any plans for expansion of the API to include intake from other sources?', ""Awesome question, I'll address the two questions separately.\n\n1. Due to the volume of data that we collect, we're able to track posts by the symbol  (stocks or crypto). We also track the author post history and profile. We return information for each symbol only if the post itself mentions, describes, or references a symbol or its associated price action (or trade). Moreover, we check the author of that post has a verified user join date and passes our check for post frequency. In addition, we just implemented a background check on the variability within posts to determine if they are informative responses or alerts. We filter out posts that have very low informative response scores (an internal metric we capture). Bad actors tend to have some sporadic posting history (for e.g- Elon Musk's tweets influence stock price, but there's a clear user posting pattern that's non-sporadic in nature). We try our best on our end to filter them out.We do have a dashboard available at https://utradea.com/social-dashboard  if you want to play around with the data.\n2. Yes, currently we are working on bringing in google search volume, news sentiment, and video sources from TikTok and Youtube. If you have any other sources not mentioned above that you would like us to look into let us know.\n\nHope that answers your question!"", ""I have a follow-up question on #1. For the weighting you folks are doing for this, are you filtering by subreddit?  \n\n\nI.e. folks posting in r/Stocks are you filtering/weighitng their post history as a user in r/Stocks, or as a Reddit User who posts in any given subreddit? \n\nBranching off of that thought, What impact will the Bot accounts or accounts farmed for karma to be sold have on your weighting? Have you thought about partnering with another team/group (maybe some Data Scientist) that is working to track this? As it sounds outside of your use case scope, but still very much relevant. I'm just thinking outloud, if you're a 2 person shop that may see you folks stretch into something that is important to consider, but not necessarily something you have all the skills you need. (I mean no disrespect, I'm thinking like maybe you folks are Back-end/Frontend (UI) devs and this exceeds your specific skillset)  \n\n\n\\#2 I like it a lot, I think the tough part is figuring out the structure. I feel that many folks get information overload and also it's not easily explained when so & so company issues a BUY rating and another is issuing a sell, while Tik Tok is saying this will be the next big thing, while r/Wallstreetbets is claiming it to fail. Overall, I'm just thinking outloud, that this is trying to take the speculation out of stock research in social media, but may actually see it increase as you add on more sources. Hopefully I'm making sense.""]"
