\- Where can I read more details about this?

\- And what are credit as service products (except Onbo)?"
"[""Check out [FICO.com](https://FICO.com) and how they structure their credit scores. I think they have a few versions as well. \n\nI think Experian/TransUnion and Equifax might also have their own credit scores. \n\nUltimately it also depends what you want to do with that credit score. FICO's score is used for various types of lending from credit cards to homes etc. \n\nBut know that the score is only one part of the equation. Income, payment history etc are also important to consider. \n\nDm me if you have any more questions.""]"
