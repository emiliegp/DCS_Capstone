Viewing Credit Card History and Limit
2022-04-28 06:40:40
"Hey everyone, 

I am trying to look into the options for having users add credit cards in a way that allows us (the platform they are using) to view their credit card history and limit as part of an underwriting flow. Does anyone have any suggestions for doing this? 

We currently use Plaid to look at a user's banking history, but I don't believe this works for looking at a standalone credit card. I tried looking on Stripe's documentation but it wasn't immediately obvious that this was something they offer. 

Thanks in advance for any help!"
"['Plaid Transactions API does this. You can get both transaction history and credit limit from the [/transactions/get](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/transactions/#transactionsget) call. Happy to answer any questions about the flow if you have them \\[I work at Plaid\\].', 'Plaid or MethodFi', ""u/phoenixy1 Thank you for the reply! We currently utilize Plaid assets when a user goes throw our flow by linking a bank account. We're considering asking for additional information from certain users, such as credit card history. So, for those users, could we run them through Plaid transactions for just their credit card? Also, if they link a credit card using this flow, is there any way to use Stripe to turn this into a payment method programmatically for that user? Or would linking it as a payment method be a separate flow?"", ""The Assets API can actually get transaction history and credit limit as well, if you request an [asset report with insights](https://plaid.com/docs/api/products/assets/#asset_reportget) (include\\_insights=true), so you might not even need to use /transactions/get. There is an additional charge to get this data from the Assets API, and the pricing model is different from /transactions/get pricing, so you should probably contact your account manager or Plaid sales to understand the pricing for your user case.\n\nPlaid's integration with Stripe only supports checking and savings accounts, so unfortunately there is no way to turn a card from this flow into a Stripe payment method.""]"
