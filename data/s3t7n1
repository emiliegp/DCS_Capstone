I am keen on putting together a good list. Thanks
"['Trustly, Tink, True Layer', 'Token, Yappily', 'Token.io is used by N26 (2nd most popular neobank after Revolut) \n \nTruelayer is used by Monzo (which is probably the most popular UK neobank)  \n \nNot sure what other ones are used', ""I'm adding few more this month, but here're 73 I've got so far:\n\nhttps://www.awesomefintech.com/category/open-banking/"", ' Plaid, Validis, tink', 'Duplo (tryduplo.com)  in Africa.', 'DirectID, based in Edinburgh', 'Thanks, interesting to see that 2 out of 3 are Swedish companies. I was somehow expecting more London-based/UK or German companies.', 'Brilliant, I was not aware of them, thank you!', ""Revolut uses TrueLayer and it's working great !""]"
