Additional institutions added to top investment account API

"I often see posts in r/fintech about issues connecting investment accounts / pulling data using Plaid  or Yodlee (common pain points: accounts disconnect every \~2 weeks, data comes in ever 12 hours, missing transactions data).

We built [Realize](https://www.realizefi.com/) as a solution to this problem. Our API provides **reliable connections, real time data, and in-depth transaction details from investment accounts**. We also provide the ability to place trades, and have a number of fintechs and financial advisors using us for this purpose.

Our coverage currently supports more than 200 million accounts across the major US investment institutions (Fidelity, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, E\*Trade, Robinhood, Webull, Alpaca, and Coinbase.) We're releasing a few more major brokerages and crypto exchanges this month.

Other companies are trying to solve the problems in this space (which is great), but it seems that they're all resorting to screen-scraping or aggregating aggregators. Those approaches lead to the same issues that we've all dealt with while using Plaid or Yodlee over the years.

It's been pretty incredible to see how our customers have leveraged our API to improve their products. That being said, we're looking to partner with more developers / companies who are interested in investment account connections so that we can form our roadmap around the community's needs.

You can create a free developer account [here](https://www.realizefi.com/register) and start testing using our [docs](https://docs.realizefi.com/reference/overview). We'd love to get your feedback and learn which institutions you'd like to see next!"
"['Hey, there’s an app called Moneymade and it has exclusively fintechs on it. Many are newer and definitely not able to connect with most APIs. That’d be a great place to add compatibility from', 'Agreed! We’ll be adding alternative asset platforms in the future.']"
