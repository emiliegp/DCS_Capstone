Best way to get ALL the info (including pending transactions) from Citi credit card account....

"I want \*all\* the information from my Citi credit card account (including pending transactions).   What is the best API to use?  

  
In the past I tried Plaid but was a PITA to deal with (maybe better now?).

 Right now this is only for me, but if my project is useful I might rethink that.

&#x200B;

thoughts?

thanks,

Phil"
"[""https://docs.mx.com/\n\nMX is another one folks always talk about. I was never able to get it to work though, unlike plaid. \n\nBut if you're only dealing with one bank, web scrapping is your best bet."", ""Plaid by nature isn't going to ever be perfect, but is probably the biggest and most stable out there.\n\nIf you are only ever looking at dealing with Citi though you could try requesting access to their own API - https://sandbox.developerhub.citi.com/us/home"", ""I'm getting mine smoothly through Yodlee, not sure about pending transactions though.  It appears that Yodlee supports OAuth with Citi whereas Plaid still wants my password.""]"
