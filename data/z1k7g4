2022-11-22 15:23:29
"I am working as a Product Manager in Data Analytics at an investment bank. I would like to advance my career and move to wealth /asset management working in Product Strategy for Investment / wealth management fintech products. I want to also start my own fintech venture after I gain more experience and knowledge. 

I’m looking at top MBA programs and it’s about $150k-220k.

The MS in Data Science program is about $80k 

Is it better to get MBA from Ivy League or MS in Data Science plus CFA for what I’m trying to pursue? 

Appreciate any thoughts /advice"
"['I’m in a similar junction. Hope good feedback comes our way. \n\nI’m still an undergrad but I’ve resolved to go with data science. It’s so versatile. Graduate level finance is pretty easy imo, data analytics gives you more skills. Just an amateur impression though', ""Anyone can get an MBA, data science is harder/less common. That said, what's your undergrad? If it's in business, defo skip the MBA. If it's in a science, like math/stats/physics or engineering, then I could see an MBA benefiting you. \n\nThe idea is to have a good mix of soft skills, business knowledge and technical/analytical skills.\n\n\nGo for the graduate degree that'll give you that. \n\nAlternative/food for thought: if your goal is to launch your own company and you can actually get into and pay for an Ivy/Stanford/MIT MBA, go to one of those schools and launch it while you're studying. You'll have the lowest risk and highest resources (collaborators and sources of inspo/help) to succeed. And if you fail, you have a very respected MBA and a good story to tell. \n\nIf it's a second tier MBA, however, it's a lot less worth it. This works mainly if it's an elite school.""]"
