"Hello,

&#x200B;

I was looking to get some ideas for a paper I have to write regarding FinTech companies and a regulation that impacts said fintech. Here is an example of the first one:  Better Future Forward, Inc.; whether an Income Share Agreement is a ""loan"" or ""credit"" for purposes of the Truth in Lending Act. I would love some ideas and if you have specific topics/articles that talk about that issue, that would be great. Any help is appreciated!

&#x200B;

Thanks."
