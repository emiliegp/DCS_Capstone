"Hi Folks, 

I'm new to the Fintech space and really keen to learn more about it (especially in North America - US, Canada). Any suggestions for great resources that take a person through the critical parts? e.g. infrastructure layers, connections, APIs, where FinTechs make their money, what the interchange is, etc.   
Great podcasts, books, articles, YouTube channels etc are welcome. Many thanks"
