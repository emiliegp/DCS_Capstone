"Hello,

If I want to bring my own EMV card reader (e.g. [https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Emv-CR100-Mobile-Portable-Android-IOS\_1600302865347.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.topad\_classic.d\_image.7ef26028MiEXQb](https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/Emv-CR100-Mobile-Portable-Android-IOS_1600302865347.html?spm=a2700.galleryofferlist.topad_classic.d_image.7ef26028MiEXQb))  


Is there a way to integrate it just with software/APIs with a payment processor or is there a lot of certification require for each and every EMV device one wishes to start processing payments for?"
"[""There's a ton of certifications needed, it's a massive pain in the ass. So that's why they all include their own"", 'No.', ""It will depend on if the hardware you would like to use can be reprogrammed to connect to a payment processor. Some hardware is locked and a new terminal is required. Some payment processors offer free mobile readers with a merchant account or they may even give you a leasing option if you're not 100% set on buying/financing one."", 'So that device linked on Alibaba - can that actually be used to accept payments. Would one be able to find a processor willing to work with it? \n\nDo you know of any companies that will provide hardware (at the circuit board level) and can process payments? Square and clover have branded hardware (which I wouldn’t be surprised if they sell at a loss) and I guess their own payment processing back end that works specifically with it. I want a circuit board (oe sealed unit) I can integrate into a full solution for a client, which has a payment processing backend I can talk to from my solution (software APIs). I don’t want to be in the business of implementing EMV compliance and security.', 'Thanks. Please see my response to tubbs_chubbs', ""I'm not aware of any - not sure if this helps, but have you looked into soft POS solutions?"", 'For those questions still no. These companies are just not interested in giving wide spread access.']"
