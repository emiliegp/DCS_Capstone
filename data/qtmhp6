"I was wondering what do you guys use to ""enrich"" your transactions. I see a lot of services like herondata, fingoal etc that do it for you but isn't there an open source project ? BTW for those of you unlisted, enrichment means adding more information to the transaction from some given attributes such as a Logo for the company you just paid X amounts to etc."
