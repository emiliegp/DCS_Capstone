BNPL vs Traditional Credit Lines

"Hey Guys! 

I was reading an article on Fintech Today around BNPL and the advantages of companies offering this service. 

The article states: 

""As mentioned above, BNPL loans tend to revolve much faster than your typical unsecured personal loan. In addition, [the average BNPL loan was about $480 in 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronshevlin/2020/11/22/the-24-billion-buy-now-pay-later-battle/?sh=afc490c2f53d), compared to the average size of a personal loan, [which is $6,092](https://www.lendingtree.com/personal/personal-loans-statistics/). In other words, a lender would need \~13x the capital amount to be able to run an unsecured personal loan program as a BNPL.""

Do you think this is mostly just due to the infancy and commodity element of BNPL? Or do you believe that consumers will constantly revolve much less in (bad) debt?"
"[""It's due to the nature of BNPL loans terms. Most are short term unsecured installment loans with promotional features in some cases (no interest if paid in full in 4 months etc.)\n\nBNPL has become a major buzzword for what is really just a loan product. I jokingly (but sorta seriously) like to refer to it as modern day layaway."", 'A couple thoughts/opinions:\n\n* Target demographics for BNPL loans and unsecured personal loans are very different. This isn\'t even a balance issue - if you focus only on unsecured personal loans with $1k or less in original balances, you\'ll likely see borrowers with significantly weaker credit. \n* u/barclayk also makes a great point - these BNPL loan terms range from 4 weeks to 12 months, whereas unsecured personal loans are usually 3-5 years. So by nature, BNPL loans tend to pay off faster vs unsecured personal loans. \n* ""In other words, a lender would need \\~13x the capital amount to be able to run an unsecured personal loan program as a BNPL."" - this is natural if your funded loan balances are higher and your origination volume is higher. This ignores the more extensive underwriting model needed for BNPL, where you underwrite both the consumer and the merchant (most of the time, but not always).', 'It absolutely is modern day layaway! \n\nIn more recent years, BNPL underwriting has become heavily consumer-centric so the main differentiating factor of the merchant offsetting some of the credit risk is starting to become minimalized (thereby ending up with a more consumer-centric loan product).', 'I’d counter that unlike layaway, with many BNPL options you get the product first (often with a deferred payment period) and the merchant subsidizes the 0% APR if it’s being offered. \n\nThe BNPL I see with Affirm is like a loan product stripped of any gamification that pits the user against their own psychology - eg auto pay setup is offered before you complete the transaction, the full term/amount of interest is disclosed upfront, there are no late fees, the APR cannot and does not accrue indefinitely as with a revolving line of credit, etc...it truly is a better loan product IMO', "">I’d counter that unlike layaway, with many BNPL options **you get the product first** (often with a deferred payment period) and the merchant subsidizes the 0% APR if it’s being offered.\n\nI stand corrected (because for a second I forgot that you don't get the product right away with layaway). \n\nHowever, nowadays the merchant doesn't always subsidize the 0% APR, and there are non-BNPL lenders (mainly point of sale financing providers) calling themselves BNPL without actually doing any underwriting or structuring any risk exposure to the merchant. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>The BNPL I see with Affirm is like a loan product stripped of any gamification that pits the user against their own psychology - eg auto pay setup is offered before you complete the transaction, the full term/amount of interest is disclosed upfront, there are no late fees, the APR cannot and does not accrue indefinitely as with a revolving line of credit, etc...it truly is a better loan product IMO\n\nI wouldn't say Affirm is representative of all of BNPL, but I do agree that Affirm is doing what other lenders claiming to do BNPL should be doing. \n\nAll of those things you mentioned, fintech lenders like Lending Club, SoFi, etc do to some extent. I think Affirm's main differentiating factor is its merchant relationships. No other BNPL that I know of offers the degree of customizability that Affirm offers its merchants. If you look at Afterpay (and Quadpay and Sezzle), merchants don't have a sliding pricing scale of how much of the merchant discount they want to offer vs how much Affirm charges the consumer. \n\nNow that being said, Affirm actually operates at a loss, so even if the pricing of their loans are such that the ROA on the loans is positive, there isn't enough return on the loans to cover their operating costs."", 'It seems like maybe they’re just trying to acquire consumers cheaply into their network - their long term ambition may not be to solely operate as a merchant services business.', "">their long term ambition may not be to solely operate as a merchant services business.\n\nWas there something they said in the latest earnings call that you interpret to imply this viewpoint?\n\nIf I recall Levchin's response to the Square-Afterpay acquistiion, I remember him emphasizing their merchant relationships. Then there's the Amazon relationship, and all the other merchant relationships (Walmart, Shopify) they highlighted in the earnings call.\n\nIf anything, I believe they'll double down on being in the space in-between the consumer and merchant."", 'Their development of high yield savings and the increased robustness of the app marketplace as a standalone center of product discovery']"
