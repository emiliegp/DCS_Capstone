"Hi all,

I see that a lot of new fintech startup startups are doing business through Apex Clearning (or some other infrastructure company), until they get Money Transmitter Licence. Do you have any idea how much does it cost to get connected to their system and use them? Any ballpark idea would help."
"[""A few thoughts: \n\n* I've typically seen these kinds of agreements work on tier systems with higher rates if the volume is low. \n* Not apex but I know of an agreement with a payments service provider which was in around $100K-$200K / year for the tier level of volume we were operating.\n* Apex might have gotten as large of an adoption as they did because they are *very* tied up in the payment-for-order-flow business which is supposed to be something the SEC / Gensler is commenting on in 2022."", 'Thank you for your answer. This is super useful.']"
