What FinTech product is missing for Gen Z?

Newbie here. Have an opportunity to develop a FinTech product for a robust community. What would be cool?
"['Oh man, it’s so huge and broad. But start with the oldest approach, what kind of GenZ problem do you want to solve?\n\nFor the “cool” stuff I think you’d want to go for DeFi and Web3. For classic B2C FinTech serving underserved and unbanked also quite cool.', 'If I had a good idea for a fintech product that would appeal to the generation that is just starting to accumulate wealth and fill an existing gap in the market, I certainly wouldn’t give it away for free to someone asking for business ideas on the internet.', ""I'm pretty deep into Web 3.0. What I find interesting is that most FinTech companies have a difficult time reaching young people. With Pay Pal, Square, and Robin Hood's revenues, it should be a slam dunk - but it is not. Professor Scott Galloway predicted that PayPal will acquire Pinterest. Also Gorden Chen in his new book - The Cold Start Problem - he identifies the same thing."", ""That is probably why you don't have a good idea. I was not asking for business ideas - but the feel of the market. I want to hear opinions. You don't think I've already researched this market?""]"
