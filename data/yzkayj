Brokerage Reading Recommendations
2022-11-20 06:45:02
"I'm looking for reading recommendations for how the investment ecosystems works (introducing brokers, clearing brokers, stock issuing, etc). 

In the payments space, I've read (and would recommend) ""Anatomy of the Swipe"" and ""Payment Systems in the US"". I'd like something of similar style. 

Books, blogs, textbooks, papers are all welcome."
"['[deleted]', ""Thanks for the link! I'm looking for information that would help me build something like Robinhood/Public/Revolut. It doesn't need to be for engineers or anything: just something that provides an overview of the space and the roles in it.\n\nIdeally, I'd like to be able to travel everything that happens from placing an order to settlement/clearing. The swipe booked I mentioned does this very well for card payments."", ""Here's a write up I did last year\n\nhttps://javascript.plainenglish.io/so-you-want-to-build-a-stock-trading-app-like-robinhood-bd6903fc9ae7"", 'This is a great write-up. Do you have links to reference material used to put it together or did you primarily use your experience?', ""Mainly experience based. Share your research goal, and I'll send you couple references.""]"
