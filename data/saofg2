Payment value chain. The image is what I could find best about different players involved. Could anyone please explain what a payment aggregator (PA) is & how it differs from a payment gateway? Aas per the image money goes into PA's account at the last step. Is there another step-PA to merchant?

"['In simple terms, a payment aggregator is basically a collection of payment gateways so in this diagram it serves the same purpose. An aggregator does not handle transaction data, it only serves as a passthrough.\n\nUsually a payment aggregator helps solve the problem of enabling more payment methods (traditional banks, digital banks, prepaid cards, paypal, etc).', 'As I understand, a payment gateway is just a consumer facing interface that allows for entering details and verification of those. So do you mean there are different gateways for different modes of payment? And a payment aggregator would bundle those services and provide them as a unit? Thanks', 'Exactly. Cases may differ from country to country (some countries allow monopolies for payment gateways). A payment gateway may handle one or more payment methods (more than payment methods think about payment networks managed by different entities)\n\nEdit: I am from Chile and for example a while ago all transactions were handled by one entity called Transbank. New legislation allowed for new participants to enter the market, thus aggregators started to appear allowing e-commerce sites to allow customers to access the different transaction networks.', 'Thanks. This was very helpful.']"
