"['Askzeta.com', 'In Europe this is what the open banking / PSD2 setup allows. You delegate authority to another app to check bank data and issue transfers, which aggregates the data from multiple banks', ""Best bet now, is bank somewhere that has apps/olb that has a feature that lets you 'add' 3rd party account aggregation and then use either their PFM or export it via csv into QuickBooks or something."", 'Thanks for the tip!', 'Thank you!']"
