Neobank with check book
2022-10-03 22:33:41
"I'm currently using newbanks (chime, cash app etc.) as an alternative to traditional brick-and-mortar bank. I'll need to write a physical check sometime soon, but chime and cashapp do not have physical check book option. Can you suggest me a neobank that offers this feature?

Thank you in advance!"
"['Personal or business?', 'Check Processing usually isn’t a cost worth the return for a Neobank to take on. But I’d approach the problem in a different way… why do you NEED to write a personal check soon? Whomever you’re going to pay these days should be able to take at least one of the following which you can get even with the digital-only options you bank with:  debit card, cash, Paypal, Venmo/CashApp, or… money order (which you can get in exchange for cash). If an entity ONLY takes checks, they are severely hampering their business.', 'You can buy check books from a lot of places. Walmart even has them for sale. \n\nhttps://www.walmartchecks.com/c/personal-checks/basic/115', 'Personal', ""The people downvoting you don't understand how the financial system works. A check is a piece of paper with account number and transaction details written on it.  As long as the bank you are dealing with is an actual bank and has corresponding accounts at the clearing banks you are fine. In theory you can even hand write a check and it is as legal as a professionally printed check but good luck getting anyone to use it."", 'Thanks ducster, this helps!']"
