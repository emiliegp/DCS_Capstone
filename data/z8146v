"I have a 12 employee startup and we're looking to offer a 401k to our team, but we need to keep costs low. Which 401k fintechs are the better ones nowadays?"
"['Definitely depends upon your payroll provider for integrated solutions. Guideline is an easy to setup low cost solution.', 'Wealthfront, Betterment or any other robo advisor.', 'Was in similar boat a few weeks back. Went with Feather 401k. It’s a startup and they have a modern experience that my team is really liking. Plus got a good deal with pricing', 'Guideline is a great company.  Low cost funds. Transparent fees and almost no cost sharing to employees', 'Nice! I’ll check it out. Thanks. Any idea about 401GO?', 'Small Company here (<10 employees) and we went with Human Interest.', '[https://www.feather.credit/](https://www.feather.credit/) looks promising']"
