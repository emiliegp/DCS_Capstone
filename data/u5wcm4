"Say I had one business bank account and I had high volume of transactions for various people coming in and out throughout the day. Some may even be every few minutes or seconds. 

Would this cost my business money on each transaction? Would it be flagged as a security issue?"
"[""You are a money transmitter if the money is simply moving through you. If you are selling items at that rate (or some other fee owed to you) then you do not need this license. Money transmission licenses are expensive and state specific.   \n\n\nIf you don't think you need a transmission license, I would just talk to your bank and they'll work out a deal."", 'Youâ€™d be a money transmitter. And depending on the volumes, you might forced to get an analyzed account.', 'Thanks for answering. Is an escrow service classed as money transmitter?', 'I think yes. Google will know']"
