Is it possible to build a fintech payments app that can save the details of a transaction completed?

"Hi Everyone,

So basically my question is whether or not it is possible to build a fintech payments app that can be used to complete a contactless payment via a POS system and save the list of items paid, along with their individual prices, after a transaction as oppose to just saving the total amount paid without a complete itemized breakdown.

e.g: If I'm at a grocery store and I use the app to complete a contactless payment via a POS system, would it be possible to save the individual items paid for (i.e bread = $2, butter = $0.5), or is it only possible to save the information for the full amount paid(i.e grocery store  = $2.50)?

Sorry if this is a little unclear but I'll add more details if further clarification is needed!

Thanks so much!"
"['Newer POS systems can do it themselves, yes.  They store transaction data and use it to generate the receipts.  However, they’re not designed to interface with a card like that because payment networks aren’t designed like that.  You’d still have to type in a receipt email address to get line by line transactions.', 'I believe so, sounds similar to how companies such as iBotta work', ""Is your idea the POS side (ie the shop) or the payee side?\n\nI think you mean payee side. If so: Card networks don't receive this level of detail in the authorisation or capture messages, so it would need to be bespoke dev for you. So, integrate to the major smart POS providers. There are companies already doing this, of course."", 'Which companies do you know of that are doing or attempting to do this, out of curiosity?']"
