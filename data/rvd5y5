"Hi all, I‚Äôve noticed some recent posts from individuals who have or are looking to start new companies within the FinTech space. I co-own a global (London HQ) specialist FinTech insurance broker and will be happy to discuss and seek quotes for your firm on a professional basis. Feel free to DM me so I can share my professional details and we can go from there. Just sharing this since I know FinTech insurance can be difficult to obtain so hopefully this helps someone out there üëçüèº"
