"I myself founded a few months ago and am currently interested in expanding my team. So far, my team consists only of the founding members.

Currently, my startup does not have the financial resources to pay full-time salaries. What creative solutions does the community have when it comes to expanding my team without paying a salary in Euros or Dollars?"
"['> without paying a salary in Euros or Dollars\n\nAs an American I feel qualified to answer this question.\n\nYou could be an asshole and bring on unpaid student interns, especially easy during the summer months. Questionable legality, sure, but people get away with it all the time.\n\nThe ethical thing to do is probably to look for people who are willing to work for you as a side project for a small amount of equity, though you should be prepared for their definition of ""small"" to vary from yours if you are not paying them any cash. It\'s also risky because you can\'t fire them, really, and once they have equity they can fuck off and it\'s probably quite a pain to get your shares back. So you want to do this with people who are genuinely interested, hard-working and intelligent.\n\nThis is one of those situations where the good ""lean startup"" business advice and the good ethical advice kind of overlap. If you can\'t afford to pay people, you shouldn\'t hire them. Don\'t scale your staff prematurely, and don\'t scale by hiring. Hire because your scale demands it. Michael Seibel talks about this a lot and makes some very poignant arguments about it, [I think this is one of the videos where he talks about it.](https://youtu.be/Dgmmje5WHWA)', 'Get them drunk and take photographs of them with prostitutes, then blackmail them to work for you.', 'Agreed with u/mosskin-woast. Also, if you go the equity route, make sure to research vesting schedules. This allows you to offer equity over a time period rather than just handing out shares immediately.', 'Thank you for your advice. I watched the video and it was very helpful.', '>make sure to research vesting schedules\n\nI did not know that before. I will inform myself about it. Thanks']"
