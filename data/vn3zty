"Is there a development API for starting a ""brokerage"" using an existing one?"

"Hi. I'm interested in doing a tech startup but I need to technically have a brokerage. 

Obviously I don't want to create a real broker. But I want to make something like one that basically piggy backs on an existing broker and provides me liquidity and a broker stream.

I wouldn't want to handle any of the legal aspects that a broker would, I just want to create a custom interface using their API and providing my own features on top. Again I don't want to have to go to a lawyer for this.

I saw that alpaca has an API for brokers but I'm wondering if you need to be a broker in the legal sense to use this. Otherwise this is a good example of what I'm looking for.

Does anyone know of good competitors in that area?"
