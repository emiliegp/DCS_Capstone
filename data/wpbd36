Getting into the industry
2022-08-16 07:22:58
"Hi, Iâ€™m currently a 1st year econ student studying economics with an interest in technology. 

Iâ€™d like to be able to get into the fintech industry, but donâ€™t know what preparation I would need in order to make this realistic. I know some python, and I have a year in industry for my third year and would love to be in the fintech sector for it. 

If anyone could help thatâ€™d be awesome"
"['First find out what you\'ll do. Jobs that companies have: product, design, engineering, marketing, sales/ biz dev, analyst. If you do one of these and talk to a recruiter about an open position, a fintech company might hire you, but you can\'t go in saying ""I\'d like to do fintech please"".', 'I would love to hear some of this!', ""We've got a knowledge base to help folks like yourself to get up to speed with the terms in the  space: [https://www.awesomefintech.com/term/](https://www.awesomefintech.com/term/) \n\n**General thinking:**\n\nCareer wise, you need to pick the segment you want to go after (InsurTech, Payments, Banking, MortgageTech, Investing Tech, Capital Markets Tech, Taxes Tech, KYC/KYB compliance, etc) and get specialized in it.\n\nThe other part, the Tech (in FinTech), would require you to understand engineering much better, you can try to get away with going deeper on the product/project management and going after any of the existing Project Management certificates. Or ideally you actually learn how to code, and then get a PM certification + some experience doing the job.\n\nFrom there you can niche down (databases, analytics, BI) or move to do more strategic planning (M&A, VC, etc.).\n\n**Quick hacks**:\n\n1) go deep on web3 (you'll need to figure out lots of financial problems and have fund with crypto while doing it).\n\n2) become a scout for a FinTech VC (meet lots of startups in the FinTech space)\n\n3) take a trading route with any of hedge funds, and automate your algorithms, and then make a spin off (for any of the problems you observe during your trading).\n\n**PS:**\n\nThere're also investment banking routes, financial advisor routes, etc., but I'm certain you can find folks who've done it, and interview them, if that's the route you want to take."", ""I'd switch to Computer Science and minor in Finance.\n\nEntry level is probably easier for developer work."", 'Yeh that makes sense. Thank you!', 'Me too ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚', 'Thank you very much this has been super helpful!', 'I post it in /financial carrers haha\nSooo if you donâ€™t mind you can see it there!', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/wphiq4/getting_into_fintech/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf', 'Oh awesome thanks, Iâ€™ll give it a look']"
