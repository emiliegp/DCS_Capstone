"['I don\'t think bitcoin will gain traction so that it is ""accepted everywhere like Visa"" for three important reasons.  \n\n1) It is intrinsically anti-nationalistic.  As long as there are nation states it will be resisted by those nation states.\n\n2) It isn\'t physical.  As much as 70% of the world doesn\'t have access to the internet.  Much less a connection that is reliable.\n\n3) Transaction costs.  As a retailer I don\'t even accept American Express because 2.6% of a sale is ludicrous.  I imagine for retailers to start accepting bitcoin, there will be banks and companies trying to peddle it that will take much more than this.', 'As an outsider to the bitcoin community and not one who finds bitcoin a worthwhile thing to use (my disclaimer about my view point).\n\nAs bitcoin was treated as basically a stock. I wonder if the intention was to make a new currency, or to play on people\'s in/accurate perceptions of the economy in the world during a time when people were revolting globally and finances were hit hard. \n\nBitcoin got publicized highly for a period of time, but before that my understanding was it wasn\'t worth a whole heck of a lot, and after it was back to that or maybe a bit higher?\n\nConsidering how easy it seems to be to lose bitcoins or have them ""stolen"" (ie. Mt. Gox and other exchanges that were infiltrated). Never mind how hard it is to spend them.\n\nNow I think the concept is interesting, I think its a cool step to the future, but I don\'t think its a currency and I don\'t think it would catch on in the mainstream. From a purely business perspective it would never succeed. \n\nSo I\'m wondering what the creator/s had envisioned, how the community was supposed to help and if anyone ever expected it to take off on a global scale, as the concept is not accessible to people never mind the actual currency. ', 'The block-chain technology that backs bitcoin is the biggest advancement in technology we have seen in some time. It happens to be running bitcoin and probably some other important things in the near future.\n\nLawyers may be replaced soon.\n\nhttp://www.blockchains.technology/page/423/\n\n', 'I hope you mean geologically soon, unless the blockchain has some  hitherto unmentioned application in AI.']"
