Thanks in advance!
"['Balance requests are free for cached balance.\n\nCurrently, pay-as-you-go pricing (without any volume discounts) is 10 cents per call for real-time balance and 30 cents per linked account per month for transactions -- transactions is not billed per request.\n\n(Technically the transactions pricing is per Item, basically a login, not per bank account...like if the person has checking and savings at the same place the pricing is the same as if they only had one bank account there).', '$1.20 to auth / connect an account', 'Thank you for this timely information!', '[deleted]', 'Isn’t Plaid user permissioned? Meaning, there’s a disclosure on what information you’re sharing and it requires your banking credentials. \n\nTough to believe anyone is unaware that they’re exchanging their data for a service.', 'there totally is some information there (same with all aggregators and a link to their policy). The problem was Plaid was going in and scraping WAY more information than was necessary or agreed to by the fintech or the user\n\nIf you needed an IAV to move money from Bank A to Fintech B for investment, PLaid was only supposed to get your account and routing number to get shared. Instead they were taking history of spending and selling that information ""anonymously"" to third parties. They got caught doing bad things without regret. Instead they acted sorry they got caught.\n\nEdit: Im also a privacy nutjob. I use Brave Browser and cold wallets for crypto. So I shit on Plaid because they are blatantly so bad as stewards of your data.']"
