"['terrible -- but given how that went down previously, maybe better', 'Was laid off yesterday. Just woke up to a $9k direct deposit so knew I had been laid off lol', ""Were you a AHA/PEA? I'm currently still a AHA but I don't plan on coming back to work there and have them fire me."", ""What was your position? How did you like the job? I'm a mortgage broker and have always wondered how better was. Do you know the commission structure for loan officers?"", 'Yeah AHA. And haha nice, yeah I think most are in that boat. On the plus side, if you survived this round you can basically do nothing and be okay', '$60k base, plus $500-2k bonus monthly. I wasnâ€™t the LO that signed off on the 1003. Most of them are making close if not over $100k', ""That's actually not bad considering how much better their pricing is than literally anyone else in the industry. How was the processing? Quick and efficient or did you have any issues?""]"
