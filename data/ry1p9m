How can you beat ever-increasing customer acquisition costs in fintech?

"Over the last few years we’ve seen meaningful inflation in digital customer acquisition channels (FB & GOOG) as competition has increased and changes like [Apple](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/) Ad Tracking have made attribution harder.  


Furthering competition the vast majority of fintech companies have focused on the same customer profile (subprime), with the same product offering (e.g., banking, investing, lending) and a set of ever-increasing customer subsidies to join (free money on the internet!).  


How then will a company distinguish itself in 2022 in the face of increasingly competitive and constrained digital acquisition channels?  


There are two answers –- the best companies will either achieve growth through products that lend themselves to product-led growth or partnerships represent non-inflationary distribution opportunities.  


On the product side today’s products become tomorrow’s primitives; simply offering a bank or brokerage account is no longer good enough to stand out as new APIs make it extraordinarily simple to integrate the core features of banking (e.g., saving, spending, lending, investing) into almost any app experience.  


Instead, the products that capture consumer’s imagination will remix these primitives in new and interesting ways that leverage communities, crypto, and commerce. In particular, one could expect to see more multiplayer products driving product-led growth – money is inherently multi-player (medium of exchange!), but to date, financial products have largely been single-player.  


On the partnership side, we’ve already seen [Credit Karma](https://www.linkedin.com/company/credit-karma/) partner with the [Houston Rockets](https://www.linkedin.com/company/houston-rockets/) deal and [Chime](https://www.linkedin.com/company/chime-card/) with the [Dallas Mavericks](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dallas-mavericks/) deal, as well as the Guideline distribution deal with [Gusto](https://www.linkedin.com/company/gustohq/) and the [Melio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/meliopayments/) distribution deal with [Intuit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/intuit/). Though these channels have price leverage and may raise prices over time, they represent the kind of predictability and volume in both acquisition cost and acquisition supply that has largely been missing from digital marketing channels as of late.  


Founders would be wise to note these examples – the companies that have historically been the best in class at direct to consumer marketing are now looking to business development and partnerships for continued growth, and we expect this trend to continue well into 2022."
