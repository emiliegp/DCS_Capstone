2022-12-05 02:03:54
"Hi everyone, Max here! I'm a Product Designer (ex-Nubank alumni), and I've just launched an app with my team to help you manage and get insights about your holdings (Stocks, cryptos, and NFTs) with Robinhood, Coinbase, and Metamask, all from one place. **Can you try the app and give us your honest thoughts?**

The app is live on Apple's App Store. Check it out here:  [https://apple.co/3EZrgs2](https://apple.co/3EZrgs2)

âœ¨ **With the app, you'll get insights (e.g., your best & worst investments, dividends, gas fees) about your assets and get up to date with our weekly press room.**

ðŸ”’ **Security: The app is a read-only service. So we'll never touch your investments. We also use Plaid services and encryption protocols like the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES 256) and Transport Layer Security (TLS).**

We'd love to hear your feedback, suggestions, or any question you've got. So we can continue improving the experience and adding more exciting features to the app. :)Thanks!

"[""Seems like an interesting app. Similar to Atom.Finance. I won't be able to check it out until there is an Android app.\n\n\nThis does lead me to wonder why so many fintech companies start with mobile only apps initially? My thoughts would be that if you create a web app that can scale to mobile devices then you'd immediately have a larger pool of consumers. Then the specific Apple or Android apps could be developed in time. Many seem to start with Apple only apps which automatically eliminates 130 million possible US Android users. \n\nIs Swift vastly easier to program in then React/JavaScript etc?"", ""Hi u/williamp0044, thanks a lot for your comment and for letting me know [Atom.Finance](https://Atom.Finance). I didn't know about them.  \n\n\nRE your question of why starting with an iOS app... That wasn't necessarily related to which languages were easier to code. Our stack includes RN/JS, which will also help us launch an Android version of the app when the time comes.   \nThe decision was related to the data we found and tested about our primary audience, plus other data points. This led us to be mobile-first. \n\nThanks again for commenting :)"", 'No problem. Good luck']"
