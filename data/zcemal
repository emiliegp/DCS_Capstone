"ONLY FUNCTIONALITY IM LOOKING FOR: deposit / withdraw money into user account 

Stripe or Plaid? Also, specifically which products for each?

I was mainly comparing Stripe Connect and Plaid Transfer / Transfer UI. I am unsure if Stripe Connect is really applicable for my application though.. seems more for marketplaces. Is there a different Stripe product?"
"[""Neither will work for you.\nLook into Alpacas Broker API or Traders Advisor API.\n\nPlaids Investment component is read only and this wouldn't be an approved case scenario for the Transfer component.
