"It seems like a lot of budgeting apps out there are mostly dashboards and trackers. 

I'm looking for something that will let me execute transfers either manually or automatically.

This is a feature I'm willing to pay for."

MX does aggregation.', '[deleted]', ""So a single place where you can transfer money to and from accounts at different banks? I can't think of any at the top of my head.

Aggregation on a PFM page and then external transfers on the transfers page. Would be interested to hear if anyone knows of a firm that does, though."", 'No service yet afaik, hope Stripe will do this in the near future.', 'Revolut', 'Mercury is just for businesses and is basically a worse brex.', 'Stripe has a personal finance product?', ""Assume they'll have, in the near future, some thin layer on top of banks as discussed here: [https://stratechery.com/2020/stripe-platform-of-platforms/](https://stratechery.com/2020/stripe-platform-of-platforms/)""]"
