Looking to change paths and start a new career. Bootcamps? Finance/Accounting degree?

"I recently decided to change my career path. Was working in aviation for years and slowly realized I did not want to do that the rest of my life. For the last 3 years I've been trading equities in my personal accounts and have had success BUT I'm not consistent enough to make a living trading. I found a love for the markets and all things ""FinTech."" I've considered taking a coding bootcamp and when researching some I ran across a few fintech bootcamps through Berkeley and Northwestern which are more up my ally then programming. These bootcamps are all run by the same company ""2U"" and i do get spammy vibes from them especially since when I apply I get spam called twice a day from recruiters wanting me to pay fast, BUT I'm sure it would look good on a resume. Its the $12000 price tag that has me questioning this route. Also, I am aware all the information is already online for free for me to learn. 

&#x200B;

To the main question: Is anyone here aware if it is possible to land an entry level job after completing one of these bootcamps without a financial degree. Or any ideas for a better path. Im near 30 years old and I have a near worthless Bachelors in Social Science under my belt and experience trading but that doesn't go too far in this competitive field. Any info helps! trying to start a new path in something I am passionate about. Thanks!"
"['Go for a two-year MBA. I am a CFO who came up through accounting with an accounting degree, but an MBA would show your commitment and bring you up to speed.', ""Don't have an answer to your main question, but 2U is the technology company behind these programs. So you would be taking a program through Berkeley or Northwester, the tech is just provided by 2U. 2U makes their money from enrolling people in their programs so while they may appear spammy, that doesn't necessarily mean the bootcamp itself is.""]"
