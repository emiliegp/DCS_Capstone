"Excuse the cheesy title! 

Some of my friends in Tech who are far away from FinTech asked me to explain what’s cool and hot and the FinTech. 

Besides crypto/web3 stuff, what are the things that excite you about FinTech?

And how would you explain to your friends what’s hot in FinTech?

"['All those options are great, but it’s hard to choose just one.\n\nWhat are most exciting (IMO) is the streamlining, automation, and emergence of faster/more secure payment options, fraud detection/mitigation, new underwriting/credit risk decisioning models and infrastructure for lending/credit, and increasing accessibility to previously more exclusive investment options (private companies, real estate, partial shares, customizable index funds, collectibles, and various other assets).\n\nOutside of the verticals themselves would be the general collective growth we’re seeing from companies building off of each other. Until quite recently, the finance sector as a whole had a lot of catching up to do, but is now exploding with innovation at an exponential pace.', 'Nothing on wealth management?', 'I think InsurTech will go a long way with blockchain and smart contracts.  I think that notary publics will be completely replaced by smart contract initiatives.', 'Open Banking', 'Credtech, or maybe it’s creditech, I don’t know. \n\nCredit analysis platforms to automate lending and risk decisions. No more paper bank statements sent off in the post.', ""BNPL or Buy Now Pay Later is quite popular.\n\nEdit:\n\nTo add, I follow both European and Indian Fintech markets. In both places I see there is a huge craze surrounding BNPL. I however find that in Europe its not quite relevant. Most Europeans I know despise buying on credit and as a matter of fact do not own a credit card either. The story is quite different in India, where paying in Installments for stuff you can't afford has a steady market for a while now. Its usually high volume and low value and mostly not digital."", ""I agree that it's tricky to define one. I think there are also 'hot' topics that represent combinations of the options above. **Imo the 'hot' subject is embedded finance**. You're seeing massive investments and pivots across the board as financial services becomes more consumer centric."", 'Real estate fintech is up and coming. Not as big as payments rn but something to keep an eye on. Fractionalized everything too.', ""Insurtech has a long way to go simply because of the massive regulatory hurdles. They're all just MGA / Brokers today.   \n\n\nKYC / AML is off to a hot start with Alloy and others, but its still incredibly expensive.   \n\n\nFX / Money transfer is where I would put my money."", 'Robo advisors?', '!remindme 1 day', '>KYC\n\nSo exciting', 'Good question. I’ve around ~900 FinTechs in this space. And I saw couple new comers in the estate planning. \n\nWhat’s your take?', ""I think insurtech has massive disruptive capabilities! I'm very curious to watch it play out. Hoping regulation doesn't prove to be too big an obstacle"", 'Oh, that would be so great! Digital signatures are already making some progress here, but not with the apostilles and international docs. \n\nWhat would be other use cases besides validating identity via blockchain and smart contracts?', 'BNPL has exploded in North America in the last few years. Took quite a while as it has been huge in Latin America for quite some time.', 'Can you elaborate on the fractionalized parts?', 'As in trading?', 'I will be messaging you in 1 day on [**2022-01-21 04:07:01 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2022-01-21%2004:07:01%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/s89j31/whats_hot_in_fintech/hteyxoq/?context=3)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Ffintech%2Fcomments%2Fs89j31%2Fwhats_hot_in_fintech%2Fhteyxoq%2F%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%202022-01-21%2004%3A07%3A01%20UTC) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n^(Parent commenter can ) [^(delete this message to hide from others.)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Delete%20Comment&message=Delete%21%20s89j31)\n\n*****\n\n|[^(Info)](https://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/e1bko7/remindmebot_info_v21/)|[^(Custom)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=%5BLink%20or%20message%20inside%20square%20brackets%5D%0A%0ARemindMe%21%20Time%20period%20here)|[^(Your Reminders)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=List%20Of%20Reminders&message=MyReminders%21)|[^(Feedback)](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Watchful1&subject=RemindMeBot%20Feedback)|\n|-|-|-|-|', 'Can you elaborate?', 'The biggest advantage of smart contracts is that they can perform different transactions. For example, to insure an item, one goes to insurance companies and old-fashioned legal regulations are applied and there is a trust issue and there are many issues with the insured item. In smart contract, when something happens to your belongings, the contract works directly and all kinds of slow bureaucracy and legal situations can be avoided. There is no need to create a huge insurance premium and grow the market. Only one person can directly insure. Differential. Of course, this can be applied in all areas of life, such as the internet.', 'There are lots of fractionalized investing startups that divvy up ownership of various assets with a high price point, including real estate, collectibles, wine, cars, etc., similar to purchasing shares except in a tangible asset rather than in a company.
