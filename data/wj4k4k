"Hello all,

As the title says, I'm looking for POS providers in America that can work with our business as an add on to services we offer to our clients. 

The following are things we are looking for:

1. POS systems that can have customizable rates placed on processing on top of the rates the POS providers already charge (we derive partial income from clients this way) 

2. If 1 is good, additionally, one that could allow us to withhold a partial amount of processing fees automatically for us (client wouldn't have to send us a check or make payments)

3. POS providers that charge monthly rates for systems as opposed to % fees or very very low fees (this would be very helpful) 

4. If none of the above can be found, any recommendations to POS providers with the lowest cost to highest versatility ratio would be helpful.

CUSTOM POS providers are also welcome, as we do have specific needs that most of the ones we have been searching for do not offer. 

Thanks everyone! Any help is appreciated!"
