Toronto IT professional (Database admin) looking to break into Fintech. Would love to get some guidance on how to break into it from a non-finance background?

"Any guidance on Fintech specific practices or technologies I can incorporate into my existing environment as I learn data engineering, to push my skills further?  Also, any learning centers/hubs/mentorships in Toronto for a seasoned IT professional like me?

I'm feeling the rut and a bit of stagnation in my current field of database administration, so will be transitioning soon to DE (with my manager's encouragement actually, non finance firm).  It's going to provide me the tools and skills I hope will one day make me a viable candidate to move into other fields.

As a database admin, I tend to be reactionary, not create new things or solve problems, just optimize existing solutions, and propose others to developers who have final say in how the application uses the database.  With DE, I'll be a big more proactive, start solving problems, collect data, etc.  The SQL part will be a breeze, so it's all the other technologies I will need to get comfortable with.

Does this sound like a viable plan, or would you recommend another route from my existing background?"
