"Hey Everyone! 

Have you ever wished you could set up some rules and have your investing strategies automatically executed without you having to place buy and sell orders yourself ?  These past few months my team has been building out Daedalus , a no code platform for Algorithmic Trading, that will ultimately allow users to place buy and sell orders for ANY condition you want. We are now ready for Beta Testers! If youâ€™d be interested in trying it out please check out our website [here](https://daedalustrading.tech) and fill out the Request Beta Access form! 
Or just request directly [here](https://jtp10wnd2tb.typeform.com/to/lBNaKFfL?typeform-source=daedalustrading.tech)

Thanks,
Daedalus Team"
"['Sounds really cool, would have loved if the website wasn\'t so bare. I understand it\'s just a beta and you want that ""marketing mystique"" but when it comes to stuff like algotrading it probably would have been better to show... something. I wish you good luck in any case!', 'Where are you based and who regulates you?', 'Thanks for the feedback!', 'Maybe a video of the actual product on top will do - if one can get a sneak preview of what to expect, might want to sign up and give it a try.']"
