"you got used to eat only  🍗 ?

Try out that  🍖 !

PayVolt, is a new Fintech startup which comes to give an alternative and more accessible payment method to traditional means via crypto mining.

WUT?

simple as that,

service/product provider signs to our official site ([https://payvolt.io/](https://payvolt.io/)), choose the crypto they want to accept from their consumers (ETC/ETH/BTC/RVN/ERG), and use our dashboard or API to track the mining info traffic and reward their miners.

Why the consumers will want that kind of service?

1) they get an easier access to payment method (just lending PC power)

2) higher returns when buying with mined crypto instead of credit cards

3) no transactions fees/middle man/no tinkering with mining software and transactions (the consumer just downloads the miner, choose a desired provider and press ""start"")

4) idle standing PC? no more! use it to pay for preferred service or product 

5) maybe you will find something that we missed  🙈
