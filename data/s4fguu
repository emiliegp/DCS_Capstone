"['Absolutely. Wealth is concentrated. So alternative stores of value are going to be held in concentration.', '[deleted]', 'This graph is very confusing because if you listed wealth by banks holding dollars, then it would also look like dollars were MORE concentrated than they actually are. Some of the exchanges on crypto represent hundreds of millions of people... üßê', 'The answers is no, this is actually a direct results of decentralisation and many people having small pieces of the pie. I will demonstrate with an example.\n\nLets say I have 100 coins, the coins are centralised n=1.  \nI give Gary 50 coins. the coins are now evenly distributed and decentralised n=2.  \nI give a coin to bill. The coins are now split between 3 people, but 99% are owned by 66%% of the people. The coins are more decentralised n=3.  \nGary gives a coin to Jenny, The coins are now split between 4 people, but 98% are owned by 50% of those people. The coins are more decentralised n=4.\n\nAnd so on.', 'I believe it was NFT value, not actual NFTs. From: https://www.profgalloway.com/web3/']"
