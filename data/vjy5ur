Hey guys. Im new here and had a question. My cousin was talking to me about a company called Eco. He says that its a wallet that pays you higher interest than banks. Anyone heard of it?
"['Yea, 5% if you refer a friend. I suppose a cousin would work too.\n\nMaybe they save money by not being fdic insured.', 'Where did you hear of it?', 'Their website. Maybe Google them?']"
