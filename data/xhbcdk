" I'm thinking of making some fintech based off the Filipino idea of Palawagan, that is when a group of friends puts their money together monthly at a fixed rate and when someone in the group needs money they all agree whether a portion of their stake is used. I was thinking of an app where we create groups for people to be a part of, with a stake in the group. We can hold business stakes for partnership companies and host a video conference application so that people can explain what they need the money for before you offer a portion of your funds to them.  
If interested feel free to message me.   


My experience is in building automated temp agencies."
"['What problem does this solve?', 'Interesting idea. There is already some fintech doing kind of that in the US and Europe. Here is a link for example : https://shares.io/', 'I wanted to do something like this for my family. We would all be able to put a bit in each month and if one of us falls on hard times we can help each other. Or we could all decide to lend it out, start a business with it, or even invest it. \n\nThe problem is being able to convince family to take part in it, also the question of who’s in charge of it (I’m the finance savvy one in my family, it’d be great to give my family more access to my skill and knowledge)? But it would definitely help build generational wealth.', 'So like gofundme.com… but with more steps?', ""It's called defi.  You missed the boat""]"
