Does anyone work with plaid(or similar) and have a good idea of the pricing per balance check on customers bank account.
"[""Balance is only available as an add-on product with something else (for example, often people buy it with Auth, which is used for funds transfer / account routing number, but not always). The balance calls themselves are pretty cheap -- I think the pricing if you don't qualify for any discounts is something like 10 cents per call --- it's generally the products that you're getting it with that are more expensive. There's no monthly minimum for Balance."", '$.75 with minimums', '$2 per check, min of $500 per month', 'Fintech is an innovation of traditional financial services where innovation and technology are used to process online payments via mobile or web apps.
