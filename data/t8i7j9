"['# Do you want to encounter frequent payment delays ??\n\nNuovoPay, with its proprietary [device locking software](https://nuovopay.com/), enables device leasing companies- financial institutions and carriers to protect their leased devices against nonpayment. NuovoPayâ€™s non-intrusive software sits on the leased mobile devices and can be used to flash payment reminders on device screens and block access to the device when a payment is missed. When the end-user completes the pending payment, the device is unlocked, the device data remains intact and it can be used as-is. \n\nOn the NuovoPay dashboard, the leasing companies can keep a record of their leased devices, automate payment reminders or schedule them, and block or unblock device access with a click.']"
