Is there a public data set of stock's GICS classifications?

"Is there a public API or data set for stock's GICS codes/sectors/industries? I'd like to be able to categorize and filter stocks in an app that I'm building by this ""industry standard"", though I'm struggling to find a source for this data that is not behind some API pay wall. Seems odd to pay for something that's labeled to be a standard for the industry.

MSCI offers APIs, but I can't find prices anywhere (aka can't afford it)  
S&P offers an API, but they wanted to set up a call to ""talk about my need"" (aka can't afford it)  
EOD has an API with this data, though $80/mo seems steep for only wanting access to that data to run one script off of and then be done.

Maybe I just stick with the SEC Standard Industrial Classification codes (SIC)? Or NAICS?"
"['GICS is proprietary I believe, but can be reverse engineered if you have a big enough data set of stocks.  The only gap will be government and education which arent generally public companies.', 'The Global Industry Proprietary Classification (GIPC)']"
