"Basically title. Stripe Issuing isn’t available in Canada, trying to see if I can get past it but are there any other alternatives?"
"[""I'm not 100% certain, but I believe [Marqeta](https://www.marqeta.com/) has support outside of the US for issuing. They have real-time webhook-based authorization approval."", 'Marqeta. The feature you’re looking for is real time authorization. And the feature from Marqeta that does this is called JIT. \n\nIt’s no joke, to implement it and requires quite a bit of backstops and certifications because you can’t delay in responding. \n\nMarqeta operates globally including Canada.\n\nI don’t know about your funding or company size. Marqeta cannot work with very small firms. But there’s a way to stop get access to this kind of product. DM and give you some other options.', ""What do you mean when you say 'request'. Do you want the backend call to authorize this payment transaction?"", 'Contact Marqeta, they have a great team and tools! You’ll be able to issue a card really fast!', 'Dm me.', 'Maybe checkout https://fidelapi.com/', 'https://notafintech.company/', 'Yes, are there any options for implementing such a thing?', 'Sorry, dont know any for Canada. There are other card issuing platforms like Marqueta but not sure if they are available in Canada.\n\nIf you are looking just to get transaction information when the card payment is done, you can use Fidel API']"
