Our Fintech startup educates minors - PayVolt
2022-10-08 21:04:32
"Hey Folks,

In PayVolt We built an alternative payment method to those who don't have access to traditional means like credit cards and banking especially minors.

We came up with the idea to let them pay for their desired service or product by lending their PC power, yes we are talking about crypto mining directly to the service/product provider they want.

**So... how can it educate minors about the financial world?** 

Very simple, the minors don't realize that when their parents buy them something right here and right now their parents worked hard the whole month for that paycheck to be able to buy something for the minor.

With PayVolt the minors learn that money doesn't come by magic and you have to put work for that! 

Minors have their own worker, personal computer, which they must:

**A)** Operate in order to gain money

**B)** Decide when the computer works or not (paly game or let the PC work and gain more money, you cant mine and play at the same time)

**C)**  Save money

**D)** Choose which provider they want to mine for 

**E)** Think twice before they buy something, they will have to wait again before the next purchase

&#x200B;

**In other words, minor learns Economic Education and work ethic.**

&#x200B;

**Why PayVolt?**

Minors dont have to tinker with wallets ,mining software's, and transactions.

Save in transaction fees, the mined crypto goes directly to providers business wallet, and the provider knows who and how much they mined for him.

They start mining by couple of clicks and they can track every payment in our official site [https://payvolt.io/](https://payvolt.io/) 

We give full assistance in our Discord channel: [https://discord.gg/EwPsPSkB](https://discord.gg/EwPsPSkB)

Sincerely,

PayVolt team"
"['Not sure if the “educating minors about the financial world” marketing angle is very compelling for a user. Sounds like they aren’t going to earn much money from mining and this is the consolation prize.', 'This post aims to the service/product providers, the users (minors) dont think about this.\nBecause providers usually afraid to work with crypto and minors together.\n\nUsers,mostly minors, earn ""free"" money wich then comes to understanding of saving money and some other financial understandings.', 'So you’re trying to convince PSPs that your service is educational to minors? That’s an even tougher sell. PSPs know that entrepreneurs get into the payment space to make money, not to help the children, and frankly they would be suspicious of you if the profit motive wasn’t directing your actions. Your method causes parents to pay more for electricity of which you take a cut, to the detriment of the environment - and that’s fine, we are in this to make money. I’m just saying the marketing angle isn’t very convincing.', 'I would agree with you if that was the point, convince PSPs to use my service.\n\nRight now we are serching for the early adopters and we want to work directly with the provider.\n\nTake Salad.io or GamerHash for example, they are mining marketplaces that exists very long time...also Salad raised earlier 17m dollars to expand the business.\n\nOur product gives that opportunity to every service/product provider to become alike Salad or Gamerhash.\n\nDo you suggest to go with our product directly to PSPs? Like tebex,etc..\nAnd if yes, what is the right approach to get them work with us?\n\nThanks in advance', 'Ok, so I work at a digital wallet. Let’s say you wanted to pitch me to integrate with your payment option so you users (kids) could fund their wallet accounts. First issue is that most wallets are not going to allow minors in their terms of use. So my advice is drop the minor angle altogether. But if your users were of legal age, I’d want to be convinced at minimum that my expense of integrating with you (dev cost) will be offset by my profits. Most wallets have no shortage of proven payment methods to integrate with, so that’s going to be a tough argument for a startup with no user base. I’d recommending finding other early stage startups, etc that can’t strike up deals with bigger methods because they don’t have the volume to get their attention. That would be the way I’d try to prove the concept. \n\nAlso, I’m thinking you’d be better off focussing on markets like Asia where earnings from mining are going to go a lot further.', 'Did not unerstand the ""wallet"" term you using.\n\nOtherthen that, you did not understand the startup completely to its end.\nThe minor doesnt hold the mined crypto, we dont want minors buy ilegall stuff on the market with crypto.\nMinors mining directly to the desierd service/product provider wallet and both provider and the minor(user/miner) can track all the mining info trafic and see their balance.', 'I understand the minor miner doesn’t hold the crypto. What is your use case? Let’s say I am your target user and I’ve downloaded your app and and letting you use my computing time to mine, how much $ do I make per 24 hours of computing time on average? Presumably I can spend my earnings on something… what? Can I buy something on Steam? If so, is payvolt an option that appears in the Steam cashier? Basically I’m asking you to outline the user journey. The fact that I don’t understand it means that you haven’t explained it properly, because I’m an payment industry professional. Having said that, don’t expect payments professionals to be experts on every new niche app. Most understand the niche they are expert in, and that’s about it. 99% will never have heard of Salad.', ""> I am your target user and I’ve downloaded your app and and letting you use my computing time to mine, how much $ do I make per 24 hours of computing time on average? Presumably I can spend my earnin\n\nFirst of all, i really appreciate your time and effort for answering and trying to figure what we do :) \n\nSecond of all, We still searching for our first customer (our ideal customers are providers like STEAM/G2A/G2G/etc...), but lets take STEAM as an example and lets assume that STEAM already integrated PayVolt into their work flow (by using our API).\n\nme, as a minor who wants to buy a game in steam but my mother don't give me her credit card, i just register to PayVolt, download the miner and inside the miner i chose the desired provider i want to buy a product from, in this case its STEAM.\n\nThen i press start and i am mining crypto directly to steam wallet. \n\nHow it works then? the minor lets say after a week of mining gathered 10$ and he wants to buy a game (he can see how much he mined in our site), he verifies his identity with steam and his miner (our personal authentication we made) and then steam fills his steam wallet with 10$ he mined. \n\nThe minor never holds the money.\n\nWe have our own store where we sell gift cards to Steam, Amazon and Google. but the idea is that those providers will work independent from us just like PayPal.\n\nHow much each minor earns? depends on his graphics card \n\nHopefully now you have better understanding of our product, in one sentence: PayVolt providing an alternative payment method to traditional means via crypto mining."", 'Ok I get it. Mostly…\nWhy does the wallet belong to Steam and not just yourselves? In other words, why can’t the user just mine with your app and accrue a balance, then send it to Steam? Do they have to order a specific product first before they start mining, or do they just build up a balance with Steam that they can apply to any purchase?', 'Because STEAM is the provider that receives the payment from the miners, he don\'t need us for that, in addition we don\'t want to hold peoples money due to additional regulations and to avoid ""Ponzi schemes"". \n\nWe dont want minors hold money, so they wont buy illegal  things on the NET.\n\nWe save you in transaction fees, tinkering with wallets and transfers, mining software\'s, etc..\n\nWe basically provide the ""clearest"" crypto any provider will ever get, it comes from a clear source which takes place in mining pools (you create a new crypto coins and send them directly to the desired provider you want to buy a product from, good for regulations)\n\nyou can send P2P wits us, everyone can be a provider on our platform, even you right now. Just enter your wallet address and let your users/friends/etc.. know you made up a new payment method (crypto mining payments).\n\nIn addition, we dont take fees from STEAM, we dont eat into their profits like every other PSP do, we take 6% fee from the miners themselves. \n\nOther then that, everyone can start mining with other platforms like Nicehash for their personal wallets and do what ever they want with it, with us you have all the benefits i mentioned above.\n\nNote: Steam is NOT our customer, yet :)', 'I guess I just keep coming back to the fatal flaw, being that mining crypto isn’t profitable. So I get why you need to get minor miners as the users, so their unwitting parents can subsidize the activity. Good on you if you can make it work, but it seems like an uphill battle to me.', "">od on you if you can make it\n\nFor the minors its doesn't matter if its profitable or not, we basically give the opportunity to people who don't have access to traditional means send and receive payments with us via crypto mining.\n\nin addition, crypto mining is not profitable only in the last month when Ethereum merged to POS, lets wait and see what the market will bring to us.\n\nAnyway, what would you suggest to us? now when you fully understand the  concept.\n\nAnd for what PSP you are working for? curious to know"", 'I suppose if the user’s local electricity costs are that cheap, it might be a viable payment method, but it seems pretty evident that energy costs are trending up and mining returns are trending down. I think if you are fully committed, then positioning it the way you are now is probably the best angle - getting unwitting parents to absorb the costs. However, in all honesty I think it’s a non starter. The fundamentals are only going to get worse for you. I would pivot and repurpose the tech you’ve built.\n\nI don’t want to doxx myself, but I’m a director for a digital wallet that serves the online gambling industry (poker, casino , sport betting sites). We’re always looking for innovative payment methods in that space. Your idea as is is probably not going to get a lot of traction there, but the gambling sites are all moving big into crypto for cross-border payment settling issues. If you are interested in exploring that market, I’d be happy to continue the conversation - send me a DM.', 'We started that startup because of our personal pain when we were minors, and our target audience are gamers.\n\nAnd its a very big market for us to enter.\n\nActually Gambling sites could be interesting to work with, lets give it a shot\n\nAgain, thank you very much for your time and effort here :)']"
