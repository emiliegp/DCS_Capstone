"What do you look for when choosing a fintech partner? A support team, just the tools, a certain area of focus, or case studies?"
"['I look for them to be able to do the thing I need them to do.', ""Someone that successfully bridges the gap between 'sure our product does that' (sales team), and showing how the actual API and product does exactly what I'm needing."", 'It really depends and what skills you already have. My friend handles the financial side of things(doing the businesses accounting) and handles the marketing as well as a few other things, but her partner is the one who actually builds the products/services they offer and he deals with all the legal stuff. \n\nI assume because your profile is for Synapse your looking for something your business can do. If I can make a suggestion, try to help do it all. Even if you canâ€™t directly offer a service, having a list of companies/individuals who are approved by you would be absolutely awesome. You could get a kickback for sending someone business, making it a complimentary service for your customers.']"
