"Hi Friends! I just landed at a fintech company, and I'm interested in knowing if there are any other fintech HR/Recruiters around who would be willing to let me pick their brains re: reaching ideal candidates in the fintech space. I'm currently looking for someone with experience in the payment processing area, specifically within the APAC region, but this person needs to be US based. Any thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated!"
