PayPal launching a stablecoin

"PayPal is exploring the launch of its own stablecoin as part of its cryptocurrency push, according to the company, which confirmed the development after evidence of the move was discovered inside its iPhone app. 

""We are exploring a stablecoin; if and when we seek to move forward, we will of course, work closely with relevant regulators,” Jose Fernandez da Ponte, senior vice president of crypto and digital currencies at PayPal, said in a statement to Bloomberg News. 

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies backed and priced by the value of an existing currency or commodity.

Evidence of the company’s exploration into building a stablecoin was first discovered in PayPal’s app by developer Steve Moser and shared with Bloomberg. Hidden code and images show work on what is dubbed a “PayPal Coin.” The code indicates such a coin would be backed by the U.S. dollar. 

On the Unchained podcast, Fernandez da Ponte said recently that the company has “not yet seen a stablecoin out there that is purpose-built for payments.” For PayPal’s use, a stablecoin would need to support payments at scale and have security, he said. 

PayPal isn’t the first technology giant to explore launching its own coin.

If you remember Meta has already launched its own coin Diem but it has not gained popularity, yet."
"['This may be overblown a bit. In my talks with PayPal a couple of months ago, they leverage Paxos to run their existing crypto offerings. Paxos has a stablecoin, USDP. PayPal may be entering into agreement to run USDP as PayPal Coin.', 'Agreed.\n\nI wrote a long Twitter thread about this. Doubles down comments I made last year.\n\nPrediction:\n\n1. PayPal will launch a branded stablecoin\n2. It\'ll be white labeled from a partner\n3. The partner will be Paxos --> white labeled $USDP\n\nShort version:\n\n* PayPal isn\'t a bank.\n* There\'s a LOT of problems with non-bank entities issuing dollar-backed stablecoins.\n* There\'s nonetheless a big upside to PayPal having a stablecoin: (1) cut costs, (2) more data on transactions even when they ""leave"" PayPal.\n* They\'ll white label a partner bank\'s stablecoin.\n* Paxos is already the PayPal crypto partner. And offers a white labeled stablecoin USDP. Lots of adoption already - BUSD, Novi.\n* PayPal has a Bitlicense in NY. That limits the tokens they can offer. Guess what\'s already on the approved list? USDP.\n\nFull writeup:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/KleeBeard/status/1481311901372108803?s=20']"
