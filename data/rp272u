"Looking for places to discuss and learn about these topics (ex: subreddits, discords, meet-ups, etc.)"
"['Iâ€™ve seen some Open Banking posts here in this sub. Not aware of any others that are active enough, though. \n\nWhat is specifically your interest, OP? I work in this sector and may be able to help :)', 'I am currently working in open banking with quite a few aggregators. If you have any specific question, ping me.', ""It is true the subreddit lacks more on this subject.\nI'd be keen to see how the payment side is implemented with merchants here in the UK. Are they going with a traditional PSP or a fintech, what sort of services are they using, and what challenges have they faced?"", 'Crypto? Do some research into Algorand', 'Is anyone aware of any open banking initiatives in the African continent ?', ""Thanks, I'll get some discussions going on this sub then!\n\nI'm interested in how open finance could and should evolve in the next few years and potential opportunities for consumers/fintechs. Would be great to chat with you or anyone else interested - just dm me.\n\nFor some background I'm a Canadian software developer looking to contribute to the country's eventual open banking ecosystem (targeted for 2023). That'd likely be through building some open source tools or fintech product. In the mean time i've been researching open banking in the AU/UK"", 'Which initiative do you consider the most successful and which  one the most ground-breaking ? Thanks for your insights :)', 'Yes. Nigeria and South Africa have some startups focusing on this space.\n\nSouth Africa:\n- truID (https://truid.co.za)\n- Stitch (https://stitch.money), also present in Nigeria\n\nNigeria:\n- OnePipe (https://onepipe.com)\n- Okra (https://okra.ng)', '[https://www.pngme.com](https://www.pngme.com/) is another one', 'Happy to DM on this topic - feel free to ping me :) \n\nI\'ll add some comments to your question here as well, so that others can also join the conversation if they have anything to add.\n\n**tl;dr:** I see big impact for consumers in terms of (1) UX / experience; (2) credit / loans / financing options with more affordable interest rates; (3) eCommerce customization and ownership of your data - just to name a few.\n\n\\---\n\nOpen Banking is still a fairly new space, so the full potential to consumers is still unfolding. The key principle is that you\'re the owner of your data (not your bank), so you can do whatever you want with it. This means: you should be able to take your banking data to other new bank / fintech / company that you\'d like (including your existing credit card limit, financing loans, historical data, etc). \n\nThis is big because fintechs and neobanks would not have any data on new consumers, so they would need you to start using their services to first ""generate"" data, to then start offering better credit limits, specific financing products, better interest rates (vs. big banks), or any customization based on your profile. \n\nIt is also big because now you\'re not dependent on any one bank anymore, so big banks will need to focus on having a great experience and more affordable in terms of interest rates. \n\nThis is a paradigm shift for how big banks operate because originally they pay no attention to what the customer wants, but focus on what will maximize value for them (and they could do so, given their barriers to entry and bargain power). Which means they will need to start to give a shit about UX, customer experience, and putting customers first in their product journey. This diminish barriers to entry to fintechs / new entrants to compete with these big banks (you can just see what is the credit limit from big banks given a specific risk profile and match it, for instance, using a more lean infrastructure on credit risk modeling).\n\nThere are also some obvious uses to Open Banking data - such as personal finance managers (PFMs) that aggregate your financial data into a single app and make your life easier - this has been the main use, AFAIK on Open Banking in UK. But how these platforms will monetize and maintain a sustainable business model is still unclear to me.\n\nOn eCommerce/marketplaces, I see a big potential as well, given that 3rd party cookies are going away - and now companies need to generate 1st party data to be able to customize their offerings as they are used to do (and as consumers are also used to) to provide relevancy to their consumers. Also - think in terms of customization of front page: eComm/mktplaces today homepages show you what you\'d probably like to buy... imagine that with open banking, they could show you what you\'d like to buy PLUS what you CAN afford given your past purchase history and credit limits.\n\nAnyways - this is just the beggining, not to mention anything on payment initiation which is also HUGE with Open Banking and, if you\'d like, I can go more in detail on it.', 'Just found out about Duplo, too. (Https://Tryduplo.com and API docs at Https://developers.tryduplo.com)', 'Union54.com', 'In Africa I am following the activity of  two players: https://union54.com and Duplo https://www.tryduplo.com/', '&#x200B;\n\n>This is a paradigm shift for how big banks operate because originally they pay no attention to what the customer wants, but focus on what will maximize value for them\n\nCurious if you have any observations about consumer perception towards open banking/finance?\n\nA Canadian senator mentioned that a lot of consumers are unaware that banks are doing what you mentioned at their expense. He thought education on the benefits of open banking would be one the big barriers to its adoption. ([Here\'s the podcast episode for anyone interested](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/senator-colin-deacon-talks-open-banking-competition/id1078453487?i=1000536553772))\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>This is big because fintechs and neobanks would not have any data on new consumers, so they would need you to start using their services to first ""generate"" data, to then start offering better credit limits, specific financing products, better interest rates (vs. big banks), or any customization based on your profile.\n\nHow much customization have you seen? Have fintechs been able to innovate using  this data?\n\nMore specifically i\'m curious how true this ""chicken vs. egg"" problem is, and how some fintechs have overcome it (cc /u/templareddit):\n\n* Fintechs need a modest amount of banking data to learn to make innovative products (ex: through training machine learning models, learning how to assess transactional data for loan eligibility, etc.).\n* In order to get this data they need customers who are willing to share data, but that seems difficult without an innovative product or some other incentive to share data\n* The result could be that new entrants initially have to rely on aggregator products for ""insights""/data-enrichment, like the ones [saltedge](https://www.saltedge.com/products/data_enrichment) and [flinks](https://flinks.com/attributes/) provide (and interestingly not plaid), which may be expensive and inflexible.\n\nIf the above is true then i\'m hoping it doesn\'t replace one oligopoly (banks) with another (aggregators). It seems tricky to solve this since people aren\'t willingly going to donate their financial data for fintechs to experiment with, and having that data is a competitive advantage for aggregators.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>...personal finance managers (PFMs) that aggregate your financial data into a single app and make your life easier - this has been the main use\n\nIs there a company you\'ve noticed that stands out in this area?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>On eCommerce/marketplaces, I see a big potential as well, given that 3rd party cookies are going away - and now companies need to generate 1st party data to be able to customize their offerings as they are used to do (and as consumers are also used to) to provide relevancy to their consumers\n\nI didn\'t think about eCommerce and 3rd party cookies, that\'s a great connection to make!\n\nIt\'ll be interesting to see how these sites incentivize shoppers to share their data. Maybe they\'ll collect it while initiating a payment.']"
