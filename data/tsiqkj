Where do CFOs hang out online?
2022-03-31 07:43:43
"Any thoughts on how to connect with CFOs and Fractional CFOs online? For such a common role, there doesn't seem to be a singular space that this group frequents.

Have sourced some LinkedIn groups, but even here on Reddit, there doesn't seem to be a community (that I've found) for this target market.

Being a bit more niche, I'm looking to get in front of CFO-style decision makers that are building ""what if"" scenarios - Startup through Series A size, or establish SMBs, that are plotting out cash flow and runway and general P&L strategy. We're wired for SaaS but open to broader verticals like E-Commerce and Consulting. Inventory related industries not yet fully supported.

Building decision making tech to compete/compliment Excel workflows for this space and not having success finding a central place. Much more individual outbound (having success).

Thanks!"
"['I would try blind.', 'I can recommend useshiny', 'There are CFO only forums. Many of us hang out in person in networking groups in various cities in the USA. \n\nLinkedIn is a good resource to find individuals CFOs that support fintech.', 'I believe they hang here... ;)', 'Would you like my help to invite CFOs to a focus group to give input on your fintech technology or ideas?', 'If you put up a focus group for CFOs signup page on your site, I will have someone post it in my CFO forum who want to give you advice and the CFOs can be a sounding board for your ideas. I know it is your target for sales, so if you keep it as a no-obligation , no sales pitch, chance to get help from CFOs, it should work. \n\nMost CFOs will ask a series a questions. For example, why is this software needed, why is the price X, how will it help my my forecasting, etc.', ""Emailing CFO's seems too old school, I would also like to know the best way to reach them."", '[useshiny.com](https://useshiny.com) / [cfo.chat](https://cfo.chat) both great spots :)', 'Thanks! Yes - so far, LinkedIn has been a great resource, but is a lot of direct, one-by-one outreach. Perfectly fine in the early days of a startup but not as easy to scale longer term.\n\nAre the networking groups in most cities fairly informal - or have you seen ""sponsored by"" opportunities at all.\n\nMy challenge is that we\'re building tech for the finance space, but our roots aren\'t in finance ourselves. Makes for a positive in some respects (out-of-the-box thinking and bringing ideas from other industries to finance) but also a negative (not having the established historical connections).', 'Well put :)', ""Thanks! Super classy of you - would be thrilled to take you up on this.\n\nNot 100% sure where the line in this subreddit is on self promotion, but sharing a few links:\n\nmain website - [www.whatifi.io](https://www.whatifi.io)\n\nexample scenario model build in action - [https://youtu.be/znFwORHMpP0](https://youtu.be/znFwORHMpP0)\n\nGo-to-market is Fractional CFOs. Long game is all financial decision makers.
