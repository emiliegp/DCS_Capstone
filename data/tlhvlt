We all know that covid led to a massive increase in home deliveries, and with it came a corresponding expansion of international e-commerce.

That, in turn, offered significant growth potential for SMEs worldwide.

But even with all this growth, SMEs still have problems with their financial transactions, as there is not yet the necessary offering for these types of transactions, meaning that they are forced to use the often unaffordable solutions designed for businesses.

Fortunately, new solutions are emerging, such as BaaS platforms that offer services in foreign currencies. It seems that in 2022, there will be an increase in using them with the arrival of new players in the market.

What do you think about it?"
