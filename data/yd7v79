"Hi everyone,  
I've worked in the fintech space for the past couple of years. However, now I'm reconsidering my options and need some outside perspectives.

"[""I wouldn't. If all these technologies serve neobanks and reluctant brick and mortar banks, then your customers are traditional banks, that are hamstrung by their crappy JH/FIS/Fiserv cores and neobanks that don't even make money.

Sales, programming, etc. I manage partnerships and it’s a great gig', ""Fintech is a diverse and dynamic field, so there is no way to give an answer that works for everyone.  Can you share more about your experience?\n\nA common conversation these days is concern about stability.  If that is the problem your specialized fintech experience might help you find good positions in finance or cross-industry IT jobs.  Remember, if something is forcing you out of your current fintech job, you might be able to find something similar that meets your needs.  If you do leave, you don't need to make it a permanent change!"", 'I expected a rickroll for that link.', 'I’ve been looking at that job as well! How hard is it to move from a banker role to that one? What’s your typical day look like', 'Dm me and we’ll find time to connect']"
