Wealth Brokerage API's - How is it really?
2022-04-26 03:19:26
"Work for a Financial Institution. The aggregators Plaid and MX do not have great capabilities on Wealth or Investment portfolios and taking into account real time values. 

I have seen a number of Wealth/Investment API's being promoted here. No I don't want to talk to the vendors themselves, yet. I just want to understand what the experience is like and what information is flowing through. 

Having more accurate real time values would help us serve some of our higher networth clients to borrow against assets they hold. But I want to get that information and try to get better value understanding. I suspect that with inflation being so high, market assets will be losing value. I want to be as accurate as possible in providing our credit underwriting team with information on portfolio's as part of the borrowing process e.g. loans for ultra high net worth clients looking to buy a yacht or private jet."
"['Is the issue with aggregators is that transaction pull requests are rate limited by banks and brokerages? The only way I see you getting real time updates is via web socket connection to the different banks and brokerages.', 'We work with financial institutions and regulators, to help them experiment and connect with fintechs and other technology faster. How it usually works for us that a business unit team comes up with a ""project"" use case where they invite fintechs they\'re interested in and run experiments with them. This helps them assess their APIs, security and so on. \n\nOne of the use cases is wealth and investment APIs. I\'m interested to know if you have certain fintechs in mind?', 'This is a request coming from our Private/Wealth Banking division. It seems like it would be a reasonable request. That team wants better information on the portfolio until underwriting is closed because of market conditions right now. I thought end of day information would be sufficient, rather than real time, and pull requests may not show the value of the funds entirely because equities and mutual funds are volatile during trading hours. \n\nI have to dig into this more. I am not sure the juice in this use case is worth the squeeze, even if the market tanks. I also do not want to put this out on some of the slack channels I belong to yet. \n\nAt the same time, my thought is, if it is for Ultra High Networth clients, daily updates EOD should suffice because, we have already determined they have the assets to be classified as ultra high networth and should have the ability to pay or provide collateral. \n\nDefinitely need to think and explore this with my team more.', ""u/Prose65543 Full disclosure - my [company](https://www.realizefi.com/) offers an investments API. It may be helpful for me to layout the key things to consider here though:  \n\n\nPlaid:\n\n* Does not represent dividend reinvestments correctly and consistently across brokerages\n* Plaid often reports incorrect or null quantities, prices, cost\\_basis for holdings and transactions\n* Plaid provides incorrect, inconsistent, outdated ticker symbols, names, types, currencies for securities\n* Plaid duplicates transactions or misses them completely\n* Plaid sometimes represents option quantities as numbers of contracts and sometimes as number of shares\n   * Doesn't return option events\n* Doesn't adjust for stock splits\n* Plaid does not provide the time of a transaction, only a date\n* Data is only pulled every 12 hours (as you mentioned)\n\n[Realize](https://www.realizefi.com/):\n\n* We handle everything above that Plaid doesn't handle :)\n* Allows you to access the raw payloads directly from the brokerages so that you can extract all the information that you could possibly need (we do standardize everything as well)\n   * We're able to do this because we use the brokerages APIs, rather than scraping UIs like Plaid does"", '[deleted]', ""For brokerages that do not have a public facing APIs (or have bad ones), we will reverse-engineer their mobile client APIs. We will soon cover all of the brokerages in the US - we already cover the majority of accounts. Feel free to email me at [sean@realizefi.com](mailto:sean@realizefi.com) if you want to chat at all.\n\nWe were initially building a consumer-facing product (tried building it using Plaid) and met with Plaid's sales team but there seemed to be no plan for improvements. That is why we ended up building this - we're exclusively focused on investment accounts and it shows... most of our customers were using Plaid but switched to us due to the aforementioned improvements.""]"
