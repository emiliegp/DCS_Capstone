Question on auditing online transactions
2022-04-14 01:36:39
"I'm currently trying to create online portal that logs payments made to vendors. Like the website allows a person to buy from a certain website, but I would like the information (transaction id, amount, time) to be saved and available on their user profile for them to view.

I don't want my website to actually take any payments, but the payment is made to another purchase through the website (without navigating out). 

How can this be done? Can this be done with the use of APIs? 

I think it's possible because when I use something like Lyft and pay from Venmo, Lyft has the details of the payment."
