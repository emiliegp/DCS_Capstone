"im looking to get a career change and was wondering if this program would get me out and if landing a job with no prior experience is possible and its about $12,000 do employers look down on bootcamp graduates?"
"[""Varies, of course. As varied as every individual involved in hiring. Some people value a degree. Some value experience. Some value the response to their technical exam. Some like to see an impressive GitHub account. Some just like to see someone they could stand to be around for 8 hours a day.\n\nWorth it? Couldn't say. That's a very personal thing. You got 12k laying around? Is it an amount of money that means your family will struggle to pay rent? How valuable is your time? That's all different, person to person. \n\nA better question is probably 'has anyone taken this boot camp? Did you learn much?'. _That_ is a more quantifiable thing. \n\nGood luck."", 'Iâ€™d start with some free substack- like this one: https://substack.com/profile/2805455-medha-agarwal?utm_medium=email Medha is an OG VC who is a thought leader in modern FinTech.', 'What skills do you have / what do you hope to learn?']"
