"I interviewed for a customer service job with a big fintech (>!SoFi!<) and of course didn't get the job, I'm guessing because they are planning to return to the office next year and their offices are in fucking Utah and Florida and I'm in Connecticut so that's not gonna work.

Does anyone know any neobanks that are hiring for **remote** customer service people? It's literally the only job in fintech I would really qualify for considering my career background is mostly retail lol."
