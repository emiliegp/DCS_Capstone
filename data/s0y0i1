"Hey everyone!

**Who:** Plus Investment Technologies is a U.S.-based, remote-first FinTech startup. r/plusinvestment_io

**What:** We are developing a mobile-web application to help foreign buyers and domestic participants in US real estate markets search for, invest, or become lenders in transactions for real estate and real property, globally within a social ecosystem.

**Why:** The roots of the current market design are over 113 years old, beginning with the National Association of Real Estate Exchanges (now Realtors).

Market participants are forced to endure a fragmented search experience: There are 600+ MLSs, all governed by the rules and regulations of the National Association of Realtors. We are building a real estate marketplace/system that operates independently from NAR while remaining available for use by the trade association's membership.

We submit that markets should feature consumer-focused transactions, without fragmented search experiences. This will realize our vision of creating a massive, highly-transactional, liquid marketplace of real estate exchange.
