Where can I sell our Fintech solution?

"My partner and I spent over a year building a personal finance app. It's similar to Mint Intuit. The app supports more than 15 banks banks in Saudi and UAE. We built our backend to support 2,000 EU bank connections, but these require licensing based on each country. 

Sadly, we had to stop working on the startup as we have no money anymore and we couldn't get investors. We were both fresh graduates and our network is very limited. We're based in Lebanon, making things far worse.

I'm now looking to sell the product for a good price and was wondering if you know where I can potentially sell it?

I know the fintech industry is booming and that lots of investment is being poured, specially in Saudi and UAE, but I don't know how to find these potentially interested buyers."
"['Did you try to check out sites like [https://getacquired.com/](https://getacquired.com/) and [https://microacquire.com/](https://microacquire.com/)? Not sure if there are available in your region.', 'Just DMd you', 'This sounds awesome! I don’t have any advice, but just wanted to say how cool I think this is! I’m trying to begin building FinTech solutions myself. It’s nice to see other people who have already done this. Best of luck!', 'I passed your message on to a friend. 🙏🏾', ""I know microquire but I didn't feel encouraged as we have no revenue. I think their main target audience are people looking to venture in revenue generating saas models"", ""Thank you! Wish the same for you.\n\nIt's been an incredible journey and I loved the fintech space. It has so much potential considering everything is relatively new (at least where I'm from). It's no easy feet, but with the right ingredients it can prosper.\n\nIf you want you can reach out to me. I wouldn't mind sharing my experience, especially in the MENA region as now is the time for fintechs here."", 'Thank you, appreciated 🙏🙏', ""Thank you! I just Dm'ed you"", 'I hope you get a buyer for your app after all the work you put in. I would love to DM you about fintech in MENA.', 'No not yet.\n\nSure dm me anytime']"
