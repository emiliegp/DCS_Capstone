"I am a current sophomore at Rutgers University and I am doing a journalistic piece on NFTs for a class called Writing For Media. I wanted to use this opportunity to learn more about NFTs since I am very uneducated. Part of this assignment is that I interview notable people in the space and ask for their perspectives on it. This interview will only last about 30 minutes, and it will be over Zoom. We would need to set up for one by this Friday, so if you are free please reach out. I also NEED credentials. If you are just a crypto-bro it won't work. Someone in FinTech or a creator of an NFT would be perfect. Please and thank you."
"['Yes', 'You might like to try /r/cryptotechnology', 'Happy to help - I have a good friend who is launching a platform whereby NFT art serves as fundraising vehicles for causes in need. \n\nI myself am launching a DeFi / Fiat bridge to enable people to bring trusted Fiat transactions to the purchase of digital assets.', 'Interesting. Is this in the U.S.?', 'To which are you referring?  Regardless, the answer is yes to both.']"
