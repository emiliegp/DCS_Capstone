"[""If you don't know Rohit personally or know of him, he's as good an operator in the lending ecosystem as anyone else."", "">1. Define your product really well. You need to know the type of credit product, its terms, target market, and credit assessment details. e.g. is it a close-ended loan, is it fixed rate, are there prepayment penalties, can it be modified, do you plan to charge late fee, etc.\r  \n>  \n>\r  \n2. Go through the state's license application yourself and understand their requirements. It's pretty easy to review.\r  \n\r  \n3. Call state regulators and briefly discuss your product. Understand what's important to them i.e. what you should button up before applying.\n\nI think these three points are quite important as well - I can't claim to be an expert on state lending regulations, but I do remember looking at lending platforms that had vastly different lending structures depending on the state of origination. Some states have hard caps on interest rates, other states have a bit more flexibility on additional non-interest fees. \n\nI've also encountered a few tribal lending models (where origination companies will work with Native American Tribes to get around state lending laws), but regulation in that space is starting to get buttoned up as well.""]"
