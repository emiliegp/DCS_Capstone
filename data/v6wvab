And if you don't want to disrupt and simply want a lucrative career, you're in good shape too"", '~~No professional experience in neither finance, tech, or fintech but maybe check out jobs within Web3? That’d at least allow you to get a foot in a highly techy environment that’s still developing finance and monetize strategies.~~\n\nAaaaand I just reread your title and realized you were looking for you next study area. Never mind my above comments.', '[deleted]', 'What would you recommend to fully understand payment systems?', 'Might be jumping the gun a bit there by skipping general computer science', 'I\'m only familiar with the US market but the book ""Payments Systems in the U. S.: A Guide for the Payments Professional"" is a great start', '[deleted]', 'Thank you', ""Really doesn't make sense to me but whatever. I guess you can get someone else to do the hard parts."", '[deleted]', 'Damn dude, I\'m expressing an opinion and giving OP advice and you write this fucking novel to tell me off? Why so pissy? I wasn\'t trying to start an argument with you but it\'s cool, let\'s go. I\'m not saying ""get a degree in computer science"", I\'m saying learn the fundamentals before you start trying to train models or build AI. Basic understanding of AI/ML from a $20 online course, with no practical skills or experience, is not going to set you apart after graduating \n\nYou realize you PM\'d me on May 9th of last year trying to get me to build your startup, right? I\'m not here to take flack from someone trying to get randoms on Reddit to do free work, presumably because you can\'t build product yourself.\n\nWho even offers a degree in Fintech, btw? That\'s an industry, not a field of study. Sounds weird.\n\nI\'ve worked in FinTech for years and am in the last year of my master\'s in computer science from a top-ten program in the US. I\'ve taken graduate level courses on ML, and guess what! CS fundamentals are a prerequisite for those in most legitimate programs.', '>mosskin-woast\n\nFirst off, you didn\'t express an opinion, you stated that my opinion was wrong. \n\nSecondly, in that chat I expressed an interest in no code / low code and asked if you might like to discuss or explore collaboration. \n\nThat\'s a long way from ""Tried to get me to build a fintech for free...""\n\nThree,  I graduated from Brandeis University. Stanford also offers a Masters in Digital innovation/Fintech. NYU Langone offers a MBA with a Fintech focus, and MIT has a graduate Fintech degree as well.. So there are a few degrees out there from reputable schools. Just FYI since you don\'t seem to know. \n\n I didn\'t say like ""Take one Udemy course and you\'ll be a data scientists..."" \n\nHe is an undergrad looking to better understand the space. I was just offering a topic to explore. A basic class like Udemy is not to become an expert over night. Its an accessible way to better understand what is available, what\'s out there, what is exciting and new.\n\nWhy so contrary?']"
