" Im planning out a finance web application that I hope to launch one day but I'm a little lost on where to get information regarding compliance or US regulations that my application is expected to follow.

The app would do nothing more than access, organize and display a user's finances. Where could I read more about the needed regulations, security or otherwise?"
"['Ask ChatGPT? It does have a lot of information and can answer detailed questions well.', ""If you aren't holding or transmitting money, I'm not sure you are any type of money service business, so no regulations."", ""Sounds good to me, that's less to worry about upon launch! Might be something to consider later on when it comes to expansion or adding other features but so far so good.  \nThanks!""]"
