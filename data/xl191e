Looking for an all-in API solution and cannot find it
2022-09-22 23:21:34
"I am looking for a U.S. solution that offers all or at least three of the four capabilities below:

\- Consumer-facing payment gateway (Stripe, etc.)

\- Bank account history / aggregation (e.g. Yodlee, Plaid, Teller, Trovata)

\- Disbursements (e.g. checkbook.io)

\- B2B ACH Payments (e.g. Dwolla, Trovata, Paystand)

I can only find point solutions or 2 of the 4 in any one solution. Does anyone have any suggestions? Many of the providers out there are very vague on their websites and/or don't offer semantically clear API documentation (e.g. ""transactions"" are often just referring to infra provider transactions as opposed to bank transactions). As a result, I find it oddly difficult to understand who does what."
"['There are dozens of baas startups. I wouldn’t like to promote one over the the other but if you drop me line I will give you my feedback. However most providers range in between 350K and 1 million to run a program with full suite of offering', ""This is possibly something that [KnotAPI](https://knotapi.com) is working on but I'm unsure on the specifics."", '[Crossriverbank.com](https://Crossriverbank.com)', 'Any idea how much Teller.io costs? Don’t see any info on the website.', 'Paysafe', 'Mfs Africa', ""Yeah, I looked at unit, treasury prime, sila, modern treasury, and a few other treasury and baas providers. \n\nWe're not looking to offer banking to consumers, but need the above for our own biz money flows, so a BaaS provider seems overkill, especially as they still don't offer all of the above out of the box. \n\nTreasury providers seem to offer at least aggregation + B2B payments, but they don't usually have any disbursement capabilities. And yes, they are all very expensive!\n\nStripe Treasury may be able to do what I need but they have been utterly unresponsive..."", 'Stripe treasury is still invite only.  Have you had a look at hydrogen or Solidfi ? I think Ayden could  the same thing you are tying to achieve or you could try Basiq an open banking api if your trying to build automate receivables etc.', 'I have not and will have a look right away. We don\'t even need a sophisticated AR/AP solution. We just want to send ACH payments via API to other entities -- no need for invoicing, AI, permissions, etc. or any other fancy stuff.\n\nIn summary: we only need consumers to be able to pay us and disburse ACH payments to both consumers and businesses via API. The aggregation piece we need on top of these to set up bank rules that trigger the money movements (e.g. ""send 20% of the amount that entity X paid us to entity Y"").', ""Seems to me you are looking for payment routing.  \nThis is something you can program into API's of banks directly :   \n[https://mercury.com/api](https://mercury.com/api)   \n[https://developer.bankofamerica.com/CPODevPortal/apidocs/public/#/home](https://developer.bankofamerica.com/CPODevPortal/apidocs/public/#/home)  \n\n\nYou could also build something yourself by bending a system like:   \n[https://www.dapi.com/payment-api](https://www.dapi.com/payment-api)"", ""Switching to a bank that has some of these capabilities out of the box is a great alternative. I'll take a closer look at Mercury and Dapi (to see if we can synthesize this with our current bank). I could pair this with a gateway and checkbook for the consumer-facing disbursement flows. Thank you for these suggestions. Really appreciate it!""]"
