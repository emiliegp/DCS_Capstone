Is it too late?

So I want to start a new fintech project. It has been my dream all my life because I love technology and finance. I’m 25 years old and looking to start. But I don’t know how and if there is too much players in the ecosystem.
"['It’s never too late. There’s always going to be new ways to add value in Fintech (or any tech). Might want to make sure that there’s a market for your idea before you go all in though - create an mvp or even just pitch some potential buyers', ""There's a core of 40K FinTechs, and the whole ecosystem is about 250K companies.\n\n25 is a perfect time to start something.\n\nI'd recommend to look around what's available in your immediate network and interview folks who're already doing FinTech.\n\nAnd as others suggested, pick a niche."", 'Too many players in the ecosystem is your answer to be motivated here. This domain has inefficiencies and a lot of them. There is no one stop shop for Finance, money, payments and related fields. Understand who your customer and what problem are u trying to solve for them. Just because a solution already is available that doesn mean you cant innovate. More success to you my stranger friend!', 'Fintech is a very wide field, so depends ultimately what it is.  Do you have some details?', ""If you find a new idea that people are willing to pay for it's never too late.""]"
