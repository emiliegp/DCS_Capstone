Is climate tech the new fintech?

"Here's why I'm asking — [Watershed](https://watershedclimate.com/), a new carbon accounting tool that recently raised $60m, was spun out of Stripe. [Patch.io](https://www.patch.io/), an API-first offsets marketplace, has strong ties to Plaid. And [Bend](https://bend.green/), a CO2e emissions data API that I'm working on, grew out of Abacus, an expense management app. 

A lot of the fintech concepts translate directly to climate tech:

* Instead of financial budgets, we have carbon budgets
* Instead of USD, we have CO2e
* Instead of Quickbooks and Xero, we have [Watershed](https://watershedclimate.com/) and [Normative](https://normative.io/)
* Instead of 10-Ks, we have annual carbon disclosures
* etc.

And the skills needed are similar. Finance folks are good at getting real. Finance folks are good at applying standards-based best practices (e.g. GAAP). The climate space is sorely in need of that rigor — there's lots of inconsistency about what constitutes a net zero commitment, what is within your carbon footprint boundary, how to measure supply chain footprints, etc. 

What do you think? Do you buy it?"
"['no, regulatory fintech is a lot harder than you think. \n\nsource: was a successful CTO in regulatory fintech', 'In the long term (>15-20yrs), it looks like we are going there. We already have carbon credit exchanges, I think other products will just follow.', 'This is a very interesting take. Thanks!', 'No. DeepTech is a new ClimateTech. \n\nDuring the panel we hosted on March 1st, one of our speakers coined: FinTech for FinTechs. \n\nWhich is another thing.', ""Totally, although I would argue it'll happen faster than that, as the growth here is exponential vs. linear. 5 years ago, almost no companies had set emissions targets. Today companies representing 20% of the global economy have set science based targets, and this growth is accelerating (https://sciencebasedtargets.org/sbti-progress-report-2020). We're in the steep part of the curve.""]"
