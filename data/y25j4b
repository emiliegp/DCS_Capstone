"['>The former employee said the company has shifted away from allowing employees to work remotely, cutting some of those who don’t live near a central office. “Anyone who works from home and cannot get into an office pretty much has a big bulls-eye on their back,” the ex-employee said.\n\nThis is it.', 'This has been Frank’s edict since before the pandemic. It is not new. For a company that loves to have RIFs, this is a different way to cut the more expensive parts of your workforce and turn it over to hire cheaper, less experienced people. They have such a foothold in the industry, they can afford to make these edicts without much concern. There will always be labor in India and other countries they can and will hire. Just be aware this is how it is if you are going to work there. Some people are fine with it.', 'Wow - well they have tried to acquire MX several times and what a coincident they both have layoffs the same day….MX doesn’t have a history of layoffs though - at least not at this caliber or ruthlessness.', ""It's alright, if they have skills other employers will gobble them up. Companies that put their real estate value and middle manager satisfaction over their product and employee productivity can expect to fail to compete."", ""I've heard from contacts that most of Fiserv's tech staff has always had massive turnover rates. Hire people who are early career and underpaid, overburden them to death, and if any of them rise to the occasion, become highly skilled, and want more money, fire them for becoming too expensive."", 'FIS, too. and im sure others like Q2 have the same issues.']"
