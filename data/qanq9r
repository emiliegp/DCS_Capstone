Brand new investing app - we'd love to hear what you think!

"Hi everyone,

Upside is on a mission to deliver the data, tools, knowledge and techniques required to turn our users into confident and intentional investors, and we’d like to share our beta mobile web app with you: [mobile.upsidetechnology.co](https://mobile.upsidetechnology.co/Landing/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=fintech&utm_campaign=beta3)

Most similar apps just want users to trade, and often that is where their interest stops. But through bespoke insights, scientific analysis, and a smart framework used by professional portfolio managers, Upside helps retail investors gain the skills and confidence they need to invest in an educated, sustainable and risk-aware way.

Stop gambling, start investing. That’s the Upside.

Our web app is in its beta phase and is best viewed on your mobile web application (Safari, Chrome etc.). We will be launching an app really soon.

We are constantly developing our offering and functionality and at present, users are able to:

* **Find stocks** covering the world's biggest exchanges, on differing and relevant themes in the Discover section.
* **Add your favourite stocks** to your Watchlist which we will use to power the bespoke insights you see in your Feed.
* **Browse your Feed** where you’ll find a collection of personalised and interesting stock insights, each with its own descriptors connected to our Help Centre tool, encouraging learning at every step.
* **View specific stocks** for more detail on them.
* Take what you have learned about companies and **build your own investment forecasts** \- modelling your own ideas based on price, time horizons and conviction. You can then publish these ideas for others to see.

Coming soon we have a portfolio management function, where users will be able to take their investment forecasts and build a balanced portfolio of stocks to suit their risk profile.

We also have a commenting and follow functionality coming so users will be able to share and learn from each other in a community.

We have HUGE plans for the future, which you can view from our website. We also want our users to help shape our direction, so feedback, comments and suggestions are super important to us - instructions for submissions can be found on the relevant page.

You can find more about our mission and who we are on our website at [https://upsidetechnology.co/](https://upsidetechnology.co/).

**Your feedback is invaluable, so we'd love to hear what you think. Thank you!**"
"['Is it only CFDs? Or do I own the actual stock?\n\nA suggestion that I have is implementing pies similar to trading212.', 'Who are you regulated with?', 'I work in fintech and have closely worked with many startups. A key question I have is ""what differentiates you?"" It isn\'t clear based on your description why I would use your platform vs. one of a multitude of other investing platforms.\n\nCan you articulate the following:\n\n* Who is your ideal customer?\n* What is your killer differentiator from existing platforms that already offer insights, education, forecasts, etc?\n* How are you navigating the regulatory components?', 'Thanks so much for your feedback. \n\nThe Upside app is currently focused on stocks across the world’s biggest exchanges like the LSE, NYSE and NASDAQ. Our choice of market execution partner is nearing conclusion, at which point the asset/trade types will be confirmed. \n\nWe’ll take a look at implementing pies - thanks!', 'At present we are not regulated - our app doesn’t provide investment advice or guidance, or (as yet) the ability to trade.  \n\n\nWe are in the process of adding trading, which of course then means we will be regulated, and so we are starting this process now (starting with the UK regulators).', 'Thanks so much for taking the time to review and comment.\n\nTo answer your questions…  \n**Who is your ideal customer:** Eventually, we want anyone who is interested in investing to join our platform. But, as you know having worked in startups, you cannot start with such a broad group, therefore, at this early stage we are looking for those who are currently investing in a small number of individual stocks without any kind of framework, and those hungry to find their next opportunities but without a clear idea of where to start. We’re calling all of you pandemic investors!\n\n**Killer differentiator #1:** No view, no trade. Users of Upside must have developed and expressed a view on a stock before they enter a position. To begin with, this can be simple, but we encourage increasingly meaningful expressions of targets and rationales. \n\nThe journey is: discover stock (from a diverse array of screeners/signals/curated categories/user-generated content), add to Watchlist, ingest Feed of insights over time (strengthening the case for investment piece by piece), build an Idea (aka a forecast) when ready, form a portfolio of Ideas. Only then can they trade.\n\nThe notion of Ideas being public and a destination for comment threads (coming soon) also builds a user-to-user interaction that deepens involvement, and our proprietary scoring of Idea performance allows the more skilful users to emerge.\n\n**Killer differentiator #2:** Assisted weighted declarative investing. One of the key findings from stock trading apps is there exists a large number of users who only ever invest in a tiny number of stocks, and the time from deposit to trade is very short. \n\nFund managers don’t work that way, so why should retail investors? \n\nOnce a pool of Ideas is formed, we want to assist our users in forming the portfolio via suggested weightings. This will take in a variety of factors, beginning with a risk/reward scale, then target/conviction considerations, and then various diversification hints. \n\nCombining an intended portfolio size with these weightings gives the ideal positions, and from this we derive the required trades. There’s a lot of input from the users, but a lot of handholding from us too. We call this declarative investing (vs the imperative approach used by peers).\n\nWe are adding intentionality into the mix (even if that means adding friction), to avoid the pitfalls many retail investors see when investing - those who leap in after reading something online or being convinced by a friend. And throughout the platform, we are working on feedback loops with the intention of making users better investors over time.\n\nTrading isn’t a functionality right now, but as per earlier comments, we are in the process of including this vital piece of the puzzle.\n\n**Regulation:** At present we are not regulated - our app doesn’t provide investment advice or guidance, or (as yet) the ability to trade. As mentioned, we are in the process of adding trading, which of course then means we will be regulated, and so we are starting this process now (focussing on the UK market initially).\n\nThanks again for your time!']"
