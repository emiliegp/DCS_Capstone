Recommended ACH account verification API
2022-01-27 08:08:21
" Please excuse any incorrect wording but for my next project, I am looking for ACH account verification services (API) using account and routing numbers before I initiate any kind of transaction. Essentially I am looking to implement the [NACHA web audit](https://www.nacha.org/rules/supplementing-fraud-detection-standards-web-debits) rule. Any kind of information will be helpful.

I have looked into [routingnumber.com](https://www.routingnumber.com/routing-number-api) but I am not sure if it is safe. NACHA website [recommends](https://www.nacha.org/content/account-validation-resource-center) Plaid, Finicity, Yodlee, and many more. I want to know if someone has used any of these services and how was the experience. My company also operates in rural parts of the Pacific Northwest so I am looking for data aggregators who might have the largest database of financial institutions."
"['Plaid, DirectID and Yodlee are your best bets here.', 'You could go a different route of doing prenotes or micro-deposits to validate the account (instead of making your customers use the aggregators like Plaid and Yodlee who will definitely then get access to their data).  Although they lengthen the overall time for the end user until they can make a “real dollar” ACH, it would satisfy the rule. Users might be willing to tolerate the extra time if they knew you weren’t forcing them to go through an aggregator (and give away their online banking credentials)', 'I liked plaid. I really liked how their API for adding bank accounts/tokenizing temp worked.', ""Giact or Plaid.\n\nI've been working with the Giact gVerify and it seems fairly straightforward.  However, they charge a per-call fee which might add up over time depending on the volume.\n\nOf course there is the old / slow prenote and/or microdeposit route but the UX for this route is not great.""]"
