Best Data Aggregation option for Investment accounts in 2022?
2022-01-29 13:38:19
"We tried using ByAllAccounts for investment data aggregation a few years ago, when the technology employed was based on screen scraping, so the experience was not very good.

I understand that nowadays with the Open Banking initiative underway, aggregators are now using straight data feed connections rather than web scraping, so I figure that the quality of the data and the reliability of the connection must have improved greatly.

What would you say is the best option for aggregating investment/brokerage accounts nowadays?

Based on my initial research, the leaders are Yodlee and Plaid, but it seems to me that Plaid is more focused on retail checking accounts rather than investment accounts, so Yodlee may be a better pick.

I will appreciate any comments/recommendations from forum members who have had experience with services specialized in aggregating investment accounts specifically.

Since the data is now being pushed by the financial institutions, is there really a quality difference among the several data aggregators? What makes one company better than the rest in terms of data quality if they all get the same holdings and transactions data from the brokerage institutions?

Thanks in advance."
"[""I work at Plaid. Plaid's initial investment coverage came largely from its acquisition of Quovo, which was focused on investments, so it's actually pretty decent. If you want to check it out yourself you can create a Plaid dashboard account, which will allow you to see which institutions are supported and the current health of each one. The one caveat is that this mostly applies to the US -- Plaid covers investments in the US and Canada, but the Canadian investments coverage, while we're working on improving it, is definitely not as good. I can't speak to Yodlee's coverage."", 'From what I know plaid has more coverage in terms of financial institutions and Products support, not to mention other features like bank deposit switch and payments etc. although both are free right, you can compare by using them I guess', '[deleted]', 'Spectrum upload', ""We tried using Plaid for a social investing app but moved off of it because investment data updates on Plaid are capped at a daily frequency, with pulls happening overnight, after market hours. We also experienced account connectivity issues.\n\nWe ended up building our own [API](https://www.realizefi.com/) because the issues were so bad. Our API can automatically pull a user's portfolio positions, order history, historical performance, transactions, and more in real time. The API also allows users to execute orders. We are currently integrated with Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, and Alpaca.  \n\n\nI'd love to hear about your use case, feel free to [email me](mailto:sean@realizefi.com) or grab a time [here](https://calendly.com/realizefi)."", 'In my humble opinion, Plaid has the widest range of supported banks and good in-house support. From the POV of the technical and security parts is still something that is not fully disclosed for me and I would also like to know more about how valid it is to use it for my own purposes, since the usability is on the level.  \nHave you given any additional thought about how good [Plaid fintech](http://dashdevs.com/blog/the-value-of-plaid-in-the-fintech-industry-an-open-banking-player/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=the-value-of-plaid-in-the-fintech-industry-an-open-banking-player) tool?', 'Thanks for your reply. I tried Quovo several years ago, when it was also based on screen scraping. At that time Morningstar’s ByAllAccounts did a better job. Obviously the resources of Morningstar were much greater than that of Quovo’s founders. Do you have any comments on the question of receiving the same data being pushed by the banks nowadays? Given such fact, is there any difference in terms of data quality? Or is the differentiator simply the number of institutions connected to the platforms?', 'does MX offer an investment api with isin for funds and etc?', ""Unfortunately in the US, most financial institutions don't offer OAuth; there's nothing we can do to make them offer it if they don't. High quality OAuth and API support is not trivial for banks to build, and many (especially smaller banks) don't have the resources to build it. Plaid supports OAuth connections where institutions offer it to us as an option, which a growing number of institutions now do; we also have our own API (Plaid Exchange) to make it easier for smaller institutions to provide data via API. However, in cases where institutions don't provide access via API, screen-scraping is the only way to provide programmatic data access.\n\nPlaid does not sell customer data and never has -- the [for consumers](https://plaid.com/how-we-handle-data/) portion of our site has more info on how we handle data."", ""It's definitely better -- for example, we now get a large percentage of data via API, whereas a few years ago we were pretty much entirely based on screen scraping, and in 2021 we did a big push to improve data quality, which included a data quality audit accompanied by a bunch of projects focused on improving quality (both accuracy and thoroughness) of investments results. For the brokerage/investment institutions that we do cover in the US (and there are some that we don't -- most obviously crypto exchanges), the latest audit showed that our investments data quality should be pretty good. I'd definitely invite you to give it a try, if the last time you used it was more than 6-8 months ago I think you should see a noticeable improvement."", 'not sure.
