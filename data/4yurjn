"[""So long as there is contraband and prohibition of *any* sort, cash will have it's place in society.  It's also quite popular for small-scale tax evasion."", 'Indeed.\n\nThe business community as a wholee sadly isn\'t ethically or securely capable of handling a cashless society. Not without screwing everyone else over.\n\nCash is one valuable barrier the consumer has in reducing what they are exposing to a company during the course of a transaction. It enables you to hear about yet another breach at that company without worrying that you will have your identity stolen. It also enables you to ensure that the company won\'t have any firm information on you to sell to ""market research companies"" or data miners and at most, they\'ll be able to say ""one of these items was sold"".\n\nAnd indeed, as the article highlights, the issues at hand aren\'t just perpetrated by one party, but rather many all of which benefit from it while deceiving consumers and destroying their security and privacy in the name of profits. All of these parties disclaiming responsibility for everything they do while spreading propeganda about how good they are for you. Sound familiar? Here\'s a hint: Advertising and marketing.\n\nThose industries are highly influential, highly powerful, they\'re highly corrupt, unaccountable and predatory and desire not to be just players in the world, but **the** players that others *must* do business with in the world. They don\'t want anyone to have a choice but to accept their agreements. It\'s an easy buck to make if you can insert yourself in the pipeline between others and clamp on tight.\n\nAnd thing is, both industries *ARE* working together on an unholy partnership that will do little to nothing for consumers but leave them open and vulnerable. Credit card companies, unhappy with what they make off of consumers and merchants are double dipping by selling consumer purchase data to the advertising industry. Sound illegal? It\'s not.\n\nToo, the financial services industry actively undermines small businesses ability to compete even on the smallest scale. In a cashless society, those businesses will die since they can no longer bypass the financial industry in transactions. Customers who care about these businesses can\'t ensure most of their money is going back into that business and its employees, rather than going and paying for endless fees from middlemen all wanting their cut.\n\nHere\'s a trend to consider: between the recording/motion picture label/studio industry, advertising/marketing industry, financial services industry: Middlemen love to make it mandatory to go through them and paint a picture that it\'s evil and illegal to do otherwise.\n\nI pay cash for everything I can, I seek for ways to pay directly as possible to creators of things and directly to businesses whenever I can (especially small businesses and individuals). But hell if I\'m going to play ball with those over-entitled middlemen more than I legally have to.', 'Tokenized systems like Apple Pay help reduce the amount of information that accumulates around you as you use a credit card.

I use these services too.\n\nBut the bad side of it is that:\n\n1) They can track where the money comes from or goes to, since it\'s all digital and linked to your account now. Unlike cash, or to some extent, cheques.

My dad insists on the taxman writing a cheque to him. \n\n2) Selling of personal data from the banks/shops that you frequent, to advertising/marketing agencies. Compared to a few years ago, I have been getting more random sms or calls for services and goods and properties which I have no interest in, and which I don\'t remember ever having signed up for. We have a Personal Data Protection Act but heck I think it\'s rarely enforced. \n\n3) Since it\'s digital and not physical, more vulnerablities can crop up. This is why my dad refuses to get a paywave card or similar, and from a banks point of view, if the idiot behind the terminal inputs your data incorrectly, you could end up with extra or fewer zeroes on your balance. Unlike cash where you have to physically grab it. \n\nAnd lastly, your point about these big corps/gov/authorities trying to force their way to become the middlemen in every damm transaction is worrying. I can see some of our gov. services being offloaded to 3rd parties (which I\'m sure has links to peeps in the gov.) since the gov. says they can\'t handle everything anymore. So we have this 3rd party which ""helps"" us make dealings with the gov easier and faster, but we still have to pay them a cut for their services, and they (or the gov) makes it a bitch to use any other way, so the only option is either line up at the gov. departments or deal with the 3rd party middlemen. \n\nSorry for the rant, but your comment made me think.

', 'To be fair, middlemen do have their place in the world, but it\'s definitely not as big as they like to think.\n\nWhere those in such positions carry the most value is when they can connect people and enable low-risk transactions to happen in an orderly manner or enable people to seek the market with their product and make money with it. They also are helpful in navigating through various legal and industry process.\n\nBasically: Middlemen\'s place is in the abstract concepts of society and to guide those concepts between people - hence ""middle"", but they have a tendency to keep expanding their scope and invading the parties they work with.\n\nIndeed where middlemen become a problem is where they see everything through their own perspective and begin commandeering entire industries to suit them and mandate use of their services, rather than working to suit other industries and improving those industries doing real things and allowing people to work without their help. They also become a dramatic problem when you have middlemen of middlemen where accountability for problems cannot be discovered due to too many layers of burdeaucracy.\n\n**Consider the subject matter, the financial services industry:** They enable people to get access to money in the event of an emergency so that people can escape a problem in their lives or make a purchase that they may not otherwise be able to. It also enables people to get advice on how to proceed when they\'re in a budget kind of situation. It also enables people to have insurance on things to bring peace of mind.\n\nHowever, routinely laws and other industry regulations circle around and mandate the usage of their services. For instance if you want to rent an apartment, you may be able to present proof you get paid $250,000/yr in the face of a $2000/mo apartment, but if you don\'t have a credit rating (established by the financial services industry), they won\'t provide that apartment to you since you\'re ""too risky"". \n\nLikewise people are penalized in various transactions for actually paying things in full, rather than being subject to the financial services industry\'s processes (e.g. paying a mortgage off early). Further, various jobs and government agencies only provide direct deposit into a bank account, they do not allow you to receive the amount in cash or receive a cheque to cash immediately.\n\nEssentially you\'re punished by society for not using the financial industry\'s services, rather than being rewarded for earning the capacity to pay off everything immediately.\n\n**Consider advertisement:** The purpose of advertising is to make people aware of new products or services, to essentially be a ""bootstrap"" to launch those products into the public knowledge. Advertising should demonstrate a product\'s capabilities and explain what applications the product has and enable a consumer to consider if they need it.\n\nHowever, websites routinely get comandeered by their advertisement partners as advertisers low-ball their figures so they can force sites to deploy more advertising or more invasive advertising to make operating costs month-to-month. Advertising also has too many layers of partners and agencies of agencies and thus users online cannot find anyone to hold accountable should their computer get compromised by an ad. As a result advertising displaces website content and makes acceptance of advertising risky.\n\nFurther, the middlemen in advertising like Facebook or Google routinely can game their way out of accountability for what they do since they can claim that they ""just sell advertisements"" without accountability like exposing who submitted ads and who accepted them. They also get to perform experimentation and simply say that ""advertisers demand it"" as a measure of avoidance.\n\n**Consider the record labels or movie studios:** These people permit musicians and movie producers to find people powerful enough to line them up with venues to play their works at while managing the legal circumstances. They also provide measures to secure funding for startup of various productions.\n\nHowever, it becomes an issue where independents are impeded from competing and routinely having their content removed from sites like Youtube because a middleman thinks they own it and the law says they effectively do until it is contested in court or they admit they don\'t. It also creates a problem where independents can\'t assert their full rights and gain the royalties they\'re entitled to unless they submit themselves to industrial process administered by middlemen.\n\nIt also inflates the costs of media and they never pass those inflated costs down to creators, instead having too many hands involved all demanding their own cut. This is particularily prevailent when it\'s not a big name creator like Lady Gaga and instead a small creator who can get dropped or sued if they demand ""too much"". \n\nBasically, middlemen do have their place, but at the same time they tend to have extremely big egos, especially when coupled with big pocketbooks since they can usually avoid accountability for what they do since they can easily overcomplicate things and/or victimize/blame one of the parties they are working with to avoid questions of their own conduct.', 'Because all markets have zero cost search functions...', ""The problem tends not to be in the making of the transaction.

I argued that a problem at the bank would fuck all your money, so you should have multiple credit cards, so if one gets declined you can try another. Makes sense, right?\n\nSo I\'m suggesting that if I have bearer instruments (i.e., cash) for some of my payments available, no amount of fuckage at the bank is going to make that payment instrument stop working. Identity theft isn\'t going to destroy the value of my cash. If I have no cash, and the banks fuck up, I can\'t pay my rent or my car or pay for food or gas. Dominoes cascade and I\'m severely fucked. If I have two months of cash in the house, then I have two months to convince the bank they\'ve fucked up before the repo men come for the car. If I pay for something with a card and they accidentally ring up an extra zero on the end, then I have to fight to reverse that. If they accidentally ring me up for $100 bottle of soda when I\'m paying cash, the problem is fixed right there, before they have any of my money.\n\nIt\'s like having all your vacation photos stored on Google without any copies on your own computer. All it takes is for Google to say ""We think you\'re doing something bad with your account, so we\'re closing it"" and your vacation photos are gone. Having a copy on your own hard drive is like having cash. You might never need it, but when you do, you\'re happy you have it.', 'Some do. One of my local stores is always 10% off MSRP.

The problem starts when customers want to collude with servers to hide tip income. There are a number of urban tales that make it seem like this is possible with cash, but the margin and benefit is almost negligible.

Some tax breaks are given as an incentive for powerful corporations to use their fiscal power to fulfill a societal need...say, housing for the poor, or developing green energy technology. Others are the direct result of lobbying with one aim: increasing profits and increasing wealth. Those are the ones that, in my opinion, would be immoral...but again, that's from my perspective."", 'Dude says his friend gets 600 to a grand in tips a week, plus minimum wage\n', "">Feel free to post the list, because I myself would love to find ones to choose from.\n\nDon't know where you live, but in the UK essentially all banks offer these.\n\n>You would still need access to technology or a credit card, both of which the poor have limited or no access to.\n\nThat's a common misconception. You only need a mobile phone - which the overwhelming majority of the world's poorest own or have access to. In developing countries SMS mobile banking is preferred by the poorest and employers to cash because it means you don't have to deal with banks directly, makes it harder for your money to be stolen, and so forth. It also makes it comparatively easy for them to receive money from public and third sector sources."", 'Wells Fargo let me disable overdrafts.', ""Well, if you are one of people preparing for suprising events, you may stock food and other important things instead of money - it will be way mire useful and convenient.

Does not paying taxes on cash tips really result in negligible savings?"", ""I know this is way in the past but I just saw this response now. You are right in that the difference is negligible, but there is a noticeable difference on occasion.\n\nMost non corporate restaurants (that I've worked for, was a server for 10+years) will claim a server's cash tips by determining what they should have made by multiplying hours times minimum wage and subtracting their credit tips. If they have more than that in credit tips in a one week period they have to claim the larger number. So on a week when I got mostly credit tips my paycheck was drastically different because I made much more than minimum wage but usually claimed exactly minimum wage. \n\nSo at the end of the year it's mostly negligible, but it has made a noticeable difference on a weekly basis from time to time.

Many of the poor live literally paycheck to paycheck, and they have no savings with which to open or maintain an account.
