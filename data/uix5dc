"Hey r/fintech,

So I am a senior in high school right now and will be attending Rutgers Universityâ€“New Brunswick coming this fall. Fintech seems to be a very interesting field to me as it is a combination of two of my passionsâ€“ finance and technology. 

This may come across as a stupid question, but I can not find much information online in regards to what examples of some positions in this field are or what I would need to major in. It seems like you can be a blockchain software engineer for a financial company and that would require a computer science degree or on the other hand, you could do asset management for Google and that would require a major in finance. 

So can someone point me into the right path and explain what exactly I would need to major in/what major would be the most beneficial for me.

Thank you guys for your help!"
