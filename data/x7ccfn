"['Cool', 'Hey, what software/system/service can I use in Australia to fetch my transactions from the bank into my finance program? \n\nI am sick of importing excel files manually every week.', 'is this any different from airbyte ?', ""Guy, I can't speak for Australia, but in America banks have little to zero motivation to open up their data at all. It's the _principal_ challenge of Fintech. What most fintechs do, is have users enter in their online banking credentials and then they go scrape those pages for the data. \n\nMy advice to you is to build that yourself. Write python scripts that login to your various OLB providers, scrape to find the csv export link, and then push it into your QuickBooks or whatever. \n\nThere, now you can quit haranguing the sub to solve your personal inconvenience."", ""u/certifiedpandaboy  Airbyte is a great third-party tool for creating custom ELT pipelines and accessing popular connectors. Our focus at Pipebird is different - **we help companies work directly with their customers to share data.**\n\nImagine ACME Inc. wants to push customer data from HubSpot into its Snowflake warehouse. By contracting a third-party tool like Airbyte or Fivetran, ACME Inc. can use a pre-built connector that accesses data *made* *available via the HubSpot API*.  \nNow let's say HubSpot decides to offer native data pipelines to its customers. A team member at ACME Inc. can then activate a secure data pipeline directly from their HubSpot dashboard without involving any third-party. Since it is offering the pipelines,  HubSpot can choose to expose more data than is made available via its API (Stripe has done this with their data pipeline product) and ACME Inc. doesn't need to worry about the pipeline experiencing breaking changes because data is flowing directly from the source."", ""Not a good plan. Using bank credentials means they are stored & can be stolen. one can not just view but transfer money, that is 'cant sleep at night risky'. \n\nOpen banking API only lets you see-copy the transactions."", 'Cool cool, where is this Open banking API you speak of? Got a link? Some docs?', 'Google openbanking Australia']"
