How do I figure out what Fintech vendors my local banks and credit unions use?

"Hi! I'm a ""techie"" who works in enterprise software, but not Fintech. Right now I bank at one of the US ""Top 4"" but my partner wants me to switch to a small local bank, preferably a credit union. I'm not opposed, but I'm realizing how much I value the usability and stability and connectivity of my giant bank's online and mobile banking interfaces. And some of these credit unions and banks really seem stuck in the stone ages with terrible UI/UX that even limits what actions I can do online.

(to say nothing of the apparently [lax security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/fintech-giant-fiserv-used-unclaimed-domain/) of some of these outsourced online banking portals)

Short of signing up for an account at every local bank and evaluating its apps by hand, is there a way to know / find out what ""fintech"" a bank uses and screenshots/demos of the same? I found https://www.fedfis.com/ but they probably will want some money / I'm not even sure they have what I want."
"['If NCR has a publicly-available client list (I\'m not sure), that would be a great place to find a lot of credit unions running on that one platform.  One of the first ""FinTech"" companies, long before the term became popular-- Digital Insight, created in 1995-- was an independent vendor that provided Internet banking for hundreds of credit unions and banks. Genius-visionary strategy by founders Paul Fiore & Daniel Jacoby to build Internet banking (front-end UX) interfacing with the credit union\'s backend vendor, so each individual interface then supported ALL the credit union clients of that particular back-end provider.  At a few points at least, Digital Insight was ""bigger than its next seven competitors combined,"" I heard from friends working there.  It was acquired by Intuit for $1.35 billion, becoming part of Intuit Financial Services for several years, and then more recently acquired by NCR and merged into their NCR Digital Banking product.  (Disclaimer: Worked there 1997-1999 and helped develop the flagship consumer banking product that took the company public, helped implement the first sale of US Savings Bonds online, helped create their Network Security dept, etc.  So gather \'round the campfire, as we sing songs re-telling stories of our youth, from long before the era of ""fiber to the home""... i.e., damn I feel old now. ðŸ˜‚)\n\n[https://www.ncr.com/banking/digital-banking](https://www.ncr.com/banking/digital-banking)\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital\\_Insight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Insight)', ""Most smaller banks and credit unions use vendors for their online banking experiences. Those vendors often have integrations with the fintechs (Plaid, Zelle, etc..) directly into their platform.\n\nI'd suggest looking up some of the top OLB platforms (Alkami, Q2, Backbase, etc...) and checking out their client lists. A good spot to find those is in the form of a press release. Short of spending money for industry tools or signing up for an account at your local bank/CU this is how you'll find out who is using what tech stack."", 'I got hit up by a random message on linkedin that showed most of the BaaS infrastructures for banks / fintechs. I was pretty surprised they were able to show sponsor bank, ledger provider, payments provider, etc.   \n\n\nwww.FedFis.com']"
