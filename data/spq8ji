"I'm currently in my last semester as a an undergrad as a finance major. Was considering going to masters school for economics, but is there any other skills I can develop/ go to school for so that I can be more applicable for fintech jobs. I just feel like for a simple finance major, a majority of my tech work came just through simple things such as excel. Just wondering what you guys have in mind in order to establish a career in fintech."
"['Do you know python and/or R, machine learning/ai/neural networking, and SQL?\n\nIf not, those are a great place to get started! Otherwise, having a degree in finance will really help you get a foot in the door', 'What type of job do you want? Development, data, product management, finance, corp dev, sales? Fintech is an industry right but a job.', 'We are hosting an events specifically for this topic on March 1st. Youâ€™re welcome to join us!\n\nhttps://www.awesomefintech.com/events/2022/03/01/fintech-panel-breaking-into-fintech-in-2022/', 'Fintech is a leading industry nowadays. Most probably you have start your career in the best. To grow and learn, I think you should go for some role of developer in Python, AI, VI. That will really really boost your career.\n\nAnyways, Best of luck in whatever you do.', 'Nah Iâ€™ll make sure to do some digging on that', 'I know python from my introductory CS class but how difficult is learning machine learning/ai/neural networking and sql? Would you have to have a strong background in math?', 'For the ml and ai stuff having a math background would help(although, most people in my class have a background in statistics and it seemed easy for them). I donâ€™t have a math background, but I could follow the syntax and steps pretty well. SQL is very easy to pick up once you understand what it does and why someone might use it, you wonâ€™t master it in a week, but you can get the concept pretty quickly.', 'Hey as someone who majored in machine learning and now works as a broker. The math background helps because to have any substantiative understanding of the relevant algorithms requires higher order math like linear algebra and calculus. You can probably figure out how to make them ""work"" well enough because lots of people out there have written software packages, APIs etc. with enough instructions that don\'t necessarily require all the background. I don\'t mean to sound like I\'m gatekeeping but a lot of times in my industry when people talk about machine learning, they only have the most superficial understanding of what they\'re talking about. Because entire degrees and careers are devoted to it, it\'s a highly abstract and almost philosophical field. And I have never met another broker than can code. So if you have any of these unusual mixtures of skills, you\'ll be extremely marketable. Try Andrew Ng, his machine learning course is legendary.', ""Thank you for answering! I'm overwhelmed but excited to start learning ML"", 'No problem! If you need any assistance let me know, Iâ€™m always happy to help', ""That's so generous, I really appreciate it! I plan to take a course in ML but are there any other beginner friendly resources you would recommend to start off with?"", 'Yes! \n\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ml_getting_started.asp', 'This is perfect! Thank you!', 'No problem. Pm me if you ever want help on a project, itâ€™s good to have a network, especially when youâ€™re new', 'I will, thank you! Loving the breakdown of the math in simple terms in this tutorial so far ðŸ˜„']"
