"Hey everyone,

[realizefi.com](https://realizefi.com)

My two co-founders and I built an investments API as an alternative to Plaid or Yodlee.

Our API can automatically pull a user's portfolio positions, order history, transactions, historical performance, balances and more either instantly or every minute. It can also be used to place trades.

We originally were building a social investing app but had a really hard time trying to use Plaid/Yodlee since they only pull data every 12 hours and the account connections break a lot.

We launched last month and have a bunch of really cool companies building on us now. Feel free to create a developer account and email me at [sean@realizefi.com](mailto:sean@realizefi.com) with any feedback! Thanks."
