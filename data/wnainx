Payout from my own bank account
2022-08-13 19:38:34
"Hi, 

Does anyone know a solution that would allow me to make a payout from my own bank account, to another bank account (in the UK) from just the sort code and the account number. I understand that payouts in general require an Open Banking License, but I was wondering if there was a difference if it was just from my own bank account. 

Ideally this process is free?

Thanks"
