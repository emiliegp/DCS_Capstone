Innovative fintech startup launches Kickstarter campaign
2022-03-10 02:16:03
"Hi dear community,

Together with two friends I have developed a tool after work and on weekends that allows you to view all your assets centrally - from crypto, precious metals and real estate to stocks. Unfortunately, stocks are currently still under development. Already implemented is the connection to bank accounts, cryptowallets, precious metals and real estate in version 1.

The tool is called Assetsquare ([https://assetsquare.com/](https://assetsquare.com/)).

We know it's not perfect yet and there are still many features missing.

Nevertheless, we are very happy about feedback and if we realize that the tool is well received we will add many more cool features.

We are currently launching a Kickstarter campaign to further develop the tool with the community in the future and we still have a lot of plans 😁🚀

Now I'm sure many are wondering what it will cost. The tool will remain permanently free of charge. In the future, we will add a few more analysis features for which you will need a subscription to finance the further development. But the basic functionality will always remain free of charge!

Since there are quite a few techies in this sub, here is some info about the tech stack 🤓: React with mui, AWS Cloud-Native architecture (Lambda, Cognito, API Gateway), Postgres
