"I'm UK based and have been getting bombarded with advertisements for five or six different trading apps in the last months, chiefly eToro, plus500 and Freetrade.

It got me thinking about the business model of these startups. Are they all running their own internal broking ops, doing all the hard trading and clearing themselves?

Or are there external brokers that offer outsourced services to these startups? It would say a lot about barriers to entry to this fintech sub-sector."
"['[deleted]', 'In the US there are fintechs offering brokerage in a box.', '[Api first solutions exist](https://alpaca.markets/)', ""Very interesting. Would love to pick your brain, I'll PM in the morning!"", 'Interesting thanks! Do you know any examples?', 'No problem', 'I believe Interactive Brokers provides this service.']"
