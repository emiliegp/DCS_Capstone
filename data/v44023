Looking for an Employment Verification API
2022-06-04 03:06:53
"Hi all,

Essentially want to verify whether or not a person is a registered with a given company.

I'm looking for an API provider that verifies employment with companies like Starbucks, McDonalds, etc.

I know that [https://www.palenca.com/](https://www.palenca.com/) is an option but are there any other providers I should be looking for? (based in US)

Cheers!"
