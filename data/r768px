Listened to a few talks online yesterday. Was wondering if there's anything interesting going on there.
"[""You can live stream it from its website. Today's the last day so if you're not in Helsinki right now, you're not going to make it. :D"", ""Yeah we were there. Smaller than usual because of covid.. but still massive - and a great vibe.\n\nOnline talks can't really capture what it's like to be there.""]"
