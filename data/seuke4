2022-01-29 03:26:53
"Hi all, quick question for any vc, or PE, or investor on this forum. 

Just taking this at face value; What valuation would you give a UK based fintech that’s registered by the FCA, Canada, and 2 other territories in Asia. Plus partnerships with 3 different continents, Africa being one of them.  

Startup company with first full month operation of 30k usd in revs and 150+ users. 2nd month about 40% more growth.  

Thanks!"
"['What’s the product?\nWho’s on the team?\nHow much have they raised to date?', 'Payments company.  Team former ceo founders different industry. Raise shit all. Privately founded round 150k usd capital put in. Licenses, pre funding of bank accounts required per jurisdiction.  About to launch in 3 different continents so need to scale. \n10x revenue valuation seem fair?', 'Without auditing those partnerships and the product, I wound go beyond 5x.\nIf founders are A-level, then yeah, you can justify 10x.', 'Thanks for the feedback.  Yes validating my thoughts.  Founders I think are A level  ;). The tech guy was founding  CTO of a 30bill nasdaq listed company.  Also founding ceo of 2 companies that’s been sold.  But again different industry however still in tech.  Partners are all licensed pretty big entities.  Also recently partnered with a major bank in Asia.  Anyway many thanks for the feedback.  Weird it’s just words but just  needed some kind of affirmation!', 'Could definitely be 15-20x once you reach 7 figures or more in ARR']"
