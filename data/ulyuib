"Hello community,

&#x200B;

My name is Lucas Vieira and I've been working as a software engineer for almost 10 years now. I also have been into Fintech for a while. Although I always read many things about Fintech, I've never had an idea that I was willing to work on. Until a few months ago...

&#x200B;

My family had a few small businesses in the past. And, they always tried to avoid receiving payments on debit/credit cards, because of the high card fees and slow payout. Also, I have a colleague that has a store and she'd love to receive bank transfers as a payment method. But, my friend doesn't accept bank transfers anymore as it's too hard to manage (eg: taxes)

&#x200B;

For a while, I've seen a bunch of online companies offering bank transfers as a payment method. However, I haven't seen any type of offering like that for offline businesses. 

&#x200B;

Because of that, I started to dig into how would be possible to offer offline businesses the advantage of receiving bank transfers instead of card payments. I must say, it's not easy to implement that service for offline businesses. However, after studying the market/regulations/competitors, I think it's doable, even though there are many challenges ahead. By the way, I've started prototyping a possible solution. 

&#x200B;

And why am I writing this?

&#x200B;

Because I definitely need some help. Building software is the ""easy"" part for me, but things like sales/finance/regulation are quite hard.

&#x200B;

So, anyone is interested in having a chat?

Important note:

*I'm currently living in Ireland, so I'm trying to use the European mechanisms to make this happen (eg: SEPA payments)*"
"['Drop me a message. I may be able to help here.', 'DM me. I am in process of launching a fintech.', 'dm me', 'If you follow fintech happenings anywhere ..offline payment rampant in Africa & parts of Asia. Internet penetration growing but not everywhere.\nTypes: Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), Quick Response (QR) codes (a mates doing this in Europe), even offline POS (granted card typically needed,) but all doing their offline thing. USSD is pretty straightforward and common once you integrate perhaps find ways to slap a good UX on the bare mobile screen. Struggle to see a big USSD payment transfer use case in e.g. UK since internet access is so available and UX expectation is high but hey go discover - you already got a friend waiting. Also in UK and EU most PAYG mobiles with vouchers are USSD in action so perhaps I know nowt.\n\nEDIT: USSD cost same as a text message; vendor or customer typically bears cost obviously some customers have inclusive text mobile contracts.', 'Dm me.
