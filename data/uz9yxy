Why are Fintech banks so neurotic?

"I have read a huge amount of reviews of Fintech banks/services closing down business accounts for dubious reasons, then I opened my own Fintech account and had it closed down after three transactions, they wouldn't tell me why, but all I did was pay a supplier. To me it seems that Fintech compliance teams are all extremely jumpy and nervous compared to traditional banks whom I have never experienced any issues with, ever. Any idea as to why this might be?"
"['Possibly fear of money laundering. Smaller departments for KYC and AML in comparison to traditional banks.', 'Fraud is a major cost driver, manual review is too expensive, programmatic detection and account closing is cheap but prone to mistakes.', ""It varies pretty widely, in my experience. I worked Compliance at three of the bigger/longer running Fintechs and I honestly had a hard time trying to get Ops, Engineering and Product to be -more- strict when they were always pushing for speed of innovation and customer acquisition. It often felt like the rest of the company was actively trying to undermine Compliance sometimes because we 'ruined their fun.'"", ""This is because the entire point of a fintech is ease of onboarding. That promotes a significantly higher risk of fraud or compliance issues (BSA, AML, KYC, etc.)\n\nFintechs are really just UX / Interfaces on top of existing bank infrastructure. The partner bank is essentially letting the fintech handle compliance, user experience, etc. in exchange for fee revenue and it's FDIC license.\n\nPArtner banks can risk massive fines and losing their license if the fintech fucks up, so the compliance controls that the partner bank makes the fintech run are generally stricter. Unless you are Column and Point card haha....\n\nTLDR: partner bank risks license, fintech onboarding is higher risk."", '-\tregulators / compliance audits take more interest in **bank** accounts that were not opened “in person”\n\n-\tit’s **far** less expensive to have a hair trigger for closing accounts than to operate a single flagged account', 'It seems that, unofficially, these fintechs somehow communicate the situation of customers to each other, otherwise I can\'t explain how, if you are ""punished"" at one fintech, the same happens at another, except for the common usage patterns pursued (such as money mule ),\n  OR use the same AI systems, which have our historical memory in a fintech and monitor us when we move to another fintech.', ""So, you mean they are fearful of falling foul of the regulations and because they don't have the people to look into it properly, they think it's safer just to close the account? \n\nThat does sound plausible, I had payments in from a customer stateside and paid the supplier and they closed down the account. This is extremely normal and expected activity for an account, it's like being given a bowl of soup and the waiter throwing you out for eating it with a spoon."", 'I can definitely believe that. My supplier is in India, so I guess this may have flagged in the system, but no consideration was made for the fact I explained this in great detail from the get-go. To make matters worse, there was no willingness from their side to actually listen or see evidence from me that this was a perfectly normal transaction.', ""Did they actually do compliance checks or did they just shut down accounts they flagged up, in this case they just closed the account down and didn't even ask for any supporting documentation to aid compliance, which is of course and absolute nightmare scenario for the customer."", 'What happened to point card/ what are the flaws with column. We are thinking of switching our BaaS provider to column?', ""Thanks for the reply. I agree the onboarding is definitely a LOT easier, but in my experience it was just as thorough in terms of the information needed, or it could be argued that it was more thorough, due to the multitude of documents and video approval needed. \n\nThe disappointing thing in my case was the Fintech service not even doing compliance checks, they just went straight to account closure, which based on my research online is a common tactic amongst Fintech providers. Like you said, its the bank's licence on the line, not theirs, so maybe that's why."", 'Interesting, makes sense, thanks. \n\nDo you think it would help if I tried to get a series of transactions pre-approved before starting them in the first place, or would it not make a difference?', 'We had an AML specialist who would review and flag accounts daily for inspection and query. We also had automations for OFAC and identifying common fraud patterns. There were typically a handful of senior agents who would do additional deep dives when something was questionable to get eyes on it. \n\nAccount closures were usually a nuclear option. With the variety of checks and gates in place to even open an account it was rare something got through to being an active account that was worrisome enough for closure.', 'I believe column is in time-out on a lot of things from compliance issues stemming from Column. I would just ask them.', ""complex compliance approval workflows (escalation, rejection, approval, etc.) are difficult to build and can quickly get you into trouble if built incorrectly. So it's not something that fintechs are going to invest in immediately. Also hiring bodies to manually handle escalations often doesn't make economic sense and is viewed poorly considering the entire point of tech is scale disproportionately to SG&A. Easier for them to play it safe and deny. As data builds and time goes on they'll (hopefully) improve the onboarding engine."", 'This was Relay. I wonder if they just close accounts because they don’t have the time to go through the checks? At no point did anyone even attempt to get more info about the perfectly legitimate transactions I was making to my supplier.', 'You mean point card right? I spoke to column they said they have crazy demand and to reach out again in 30 days or so when they can move over our program and clients.', "">As data builds and time goes on they'll (hopefully) improve the onboarding engine.\n\nIn my experience, onboarding is great, it's compliance controls that are not."", 'Yeah point card sorry']"
