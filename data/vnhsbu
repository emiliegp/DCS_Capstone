Just start with the Fintech topic. \n\nA lot of good GH projects have Slacks/Discords and people you can follow. https://github.com/moov-io/ach is one of hundreds. Also search GH for “awesome fintech”. \n\nWelcome to fintech!', ""Google, OP! There's a ton of resources if you search."", 'Hi everyone,\n\nI’m starting a discord channel for all fintech founders.\n\nI’m CTO at flinks and work with hundreds of you everyday. I would like to invite you in a channel where we can exchange about news, products, technologies and use cases fintech founders are interested in.\n\nhttps://discord.gg/WAzmZpY5', 'Beg', 'You could just google fintech news… \n\nI’ll save you some of that by giving you a couple:\nFinextra\nPymnts\nFintech Futures\n\nAlso sites like Wired, TechCrunch, and Financial Times have fintech news as well.
