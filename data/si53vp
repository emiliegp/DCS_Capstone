Best ACH / Real Time Payment API?
2022-02-02 07:45:25
"Hello, 

We have around 10k/month inbound payments per month and make around 500/month outbound payments a month to our partners and this is growing pretty quick. 

I have been manually uploading the outbound ACH to our bank, but I am looking for something a little bit more robust and something that can be automated. I would also like to speed up the outbound payments if possible. 

Anyone have a suggestion for a company that has an API (or another way?) of doing this? 

&#x200B;

Thanks!"

Not exactly what I am looking for. \n\nStripe - Last time I looked they did not really do what I was hoping to do. Will look again\n\nMoov - This is the closest to what I want. \n\nThanks for the link!"", 'Hope it works - I know the team there if you need intro', 'https://teller.io/', 'Do you know how long they usually take to reply to API access requests?', "">Revolut business APIs.\n\nIs this app still under dev?
