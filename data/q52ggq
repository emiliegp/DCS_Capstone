"Hi all. I'm planning to do a PGDM in fintech but i have a purely business management background and have no experience in coding or programming. Can i still do fintech without knowing how to do code or programming.

Thank you"
"[""If you're specifically referring to your ability to do the PGDM then you should check the pre-requisites for the program.\n\nFintech isn't a single thing or something you 'do' - its a field with a variety of careers and positions."", 'Everything depends on what you plan to do. Remember Financials are highly regulated, there is AML, KYC and other regulations you need to work on. Programming is the simplest out of it - in my humble opinion. You might need also a license depending on market you will be operating on especially if you plan to make anything connected with payments.', ""Well, it depends on what you are planning to do in Fintech. If you are seeking a career as a developer obviously you need coding knowledge. But if you are planning on starting a business you could hire programmers to do the coding for you.\n\nIt's a very lucrative field so good luck!"", 'I checked the pre requisites and there were none as such. A lot of people were saying you need to learn coding to get into fintech so i was confused.\n\nThanks though you make sense :D']"
