"**Digital payments have experienced an unprecedented boom üìà in the wake of the pandemic.** According to a study by CPA Practice Advisor, there are over a billion mobile money accounts globally, contributing $2.5 trillion or 37% to the total digital payments value in 2021. The use of a mobile phone for money transfers is being accepted and becoming the standard worldwide.

The general asian market is a notable region for the growth in this tech as they have embraced the ‚ú®‚Äúsuper-app‚Äù‚ú®. There, app functionality goes far beyond payments and mere transactions. It‚Äôs deeply integrated with people's everyday lives. The industry is getting crowded, with notable leaders such as AliPay and WeChat Pay in China, PayTM in India, OVO, ShopeePay, LinkAja, and GoPay in Indonesia, LINE Pay in Japan and Taiwan, or Kakao Pay in South Korea. 

However, there‚Äôs still room for growth:

**We are sure that it's only a matter of time until we see this kind of technology in the west.** The latest [FIS PACE research ](https://www.forbes.com/sites/boblegters/2021/05/19/consumer-ownership-of-digital-wallets-is-surging-but-will-the-trend-hold/?sh=2b647c7d4980)finds that 32% of US mobile wallet users now have three or more mobile wallets, up from just 21% a year ago. Probably nothing. üëÄ

**This radical shift of the physical world to a more digitized community has brought new challenges for the whole fintech industry:** The need for speed, convenience, and personalization demanded by consumers grows  exponentially and this represents a headache for Financial institutions and mainly eWallet providers.

The ecosystem needs to rethink how to increase their range of services to stay relevant to their users and enhance stickiness while meeting the strict regulatory requirements. Let‚Äôs remember that they‚Äôre often restricted in data-sharing practices with third parties, and they face limitations when opening up their technology for third-party integrations. Not to mention that on the tech side, as most associations require building custom solutions, there‚Äôs a long integration complexity.

As we know, the typical use case for eWallets nowadays is to store money and make payments. What if we could expand the product offering in-app for end customers like microinsurance, unsecured loans or yield generating DeFi products? 

[Verso](https://verso.finance/) will enable wallet providers to unlock new revenue streams through a suite of constantly evolving add-on products that can dynamically be displayed to their customers, thus enriching their core product. 

We help CeFi & DeFi launch microfinance products, taking financial inclusion to scale by eliminating intermediaries and the necessity for various counterparty agreements. Blockchain and smart contracts will be leveraged to change the rules of the game of embedded finance. üî∑"
