{ I made a long post the other day about the boiler room esque financial firm I am currently at if you want to check that out. Basically after reading the comments to my post I started to think tech sales is a much better fit for me. }

Anyway, here’s my rundown: I’m a 22 year old at a financial firm on Long Island making only commissions from my straight cold calling job. I am going to stay here till I get 6 months experience in sales then try to make the move to tech sales. I will have finance degree from a mid/upper university with a 3.2GPA ,my series 7 license, series 66 license along with the 6 months sales experience.

Ideally, I would be looking for a remote 9-5 tech sales job that has a $50k+ base salary plus commissions. Preferably an SDR role where the extent of my responsibilities is just cold calling. Then hopefully the ability to move up to BDR/AE years in the future. My main concern is I don’t have any tech experience and if I won’t be hired because of it or I won’t be able to learn about it as quick as I think I can. 

Has anyone made a switch like this and is it reasonable with my background? I think the work life balance is better and any pay is better than where I’m currently at anyway. Tech seems like a great industry to get into now a days and my stock broker gig was a dying industry."
