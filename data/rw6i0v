"Happy New Year everyone!

I am a part of a fintech startup that primarily deals with micro-financing. At the stage that we are at now, we need to ensure that we are compliant with financial regulatory laws. All of the information I have found online has either been expensive or complicated. Would anyone be willing to give any advice or resources to point us in a direction?

Thank you so much!"
"[""Im going to assume you are in the US.\n\nThe short anser is that there are no shortcuts to compliance for lending. You need to hire a lawyer and do a survey of all the states you are operating in to find out what regulatory requirements your product or service is subjected to.\n\nYou will likely need to apply for licenses in several states.\n\nIf you don't do this, you will likely be fined lots of money in the coming years."", 'Compliance is key to a proper fintech business. And it is really important to know where you are operating. Make sure you get it right. See it as an investment.', 'I would be happy to have a conversation to get you started, I advise/mentor several fintech start ups.  DM me through twitter ""@ManagementBytes"".', 'Firstly - hats off to you for asking for help. Exactly the right place to start.\n\nEchoing the other comments - get a lawyer, get a compliance officer. A strong compliance program needs to be part of your business\'s core competency to succeed.\n\nTo start developing your own expertise, I recommend ""Who Regulates Whom"" - [https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44918.pdf](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R44918.pdf). That\'ll give you the framework you need to better understand which regulators regulate which business activities, what those regulators do, and how your business will be regulated.', 'I’m a corporate lawyer and would be happy to try to answer any specific questions you have if you DM me what specifically your startup does and where you currently/plan to operate.', 'Depends what on jurisdiction.', ""I just stood up a FDIC consumer credit card compliance program  (arguably the most stringent). Happy to help guide the way.   \n\n\nCan you give a little more background on your business? \n\nUnsecured, secured, b2b, b2c, card, etc. This will greatly affect  who I would personally recommend.\n\nFinding a compliance firm or counsel that has experience in your direct field is incredibly important.   \n\n\nwithout knowing much about your product I would recommend Hudson Cooke for legal (they handle everything from payday / title lending laws to fintech). If you are doing credit card and need help I would call Paul Ha$tings. These two firms are mainly for licensing help and state regulations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n If you need help standing up a full compliance program (and operationalize it) for national regs (KYC, AML, TILA, RegZ, Reg E, MLA, SCRA, UDAAP, etc.) I would hire a compliance firm. FSVector is very good and there are a ton of others. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHappy to help more if we can get a better idea of what you're working on and your budget!"", 'I just did this for my company (a consumer credit card working with a bank partner). Plenty of good responses already, but to reiterate, this is a must-do and it won’t be easy, quick or cheap.  You don’t need to do it all at once, but you’ll need a roadmap and risk ranking ASAP.  DM if you want to chat more.', ""You don't have a business if your don't invest in compliance. We're currently in the process of doing said legal survey/state licensing where relevant using consultants and two law firms. Expectation is ~9-12mo start to finish and a yet to be determined investment that will be ongoing for the life of the company. We're also looking to add full timers this year (post series-a) on the compliance side to ensure we're tight. \n\nAs mentioned, if you're in Fintech, compliance should be seen as a necessity and budgeted for properly as it's a major cost. We spent more on compliance than marketing last year......""]"
