"Reserach by PYMNTS shows that 67% of all consumer would be interested in integrating at least two areas of their digital lives into a single app, providing them a centralized hub to manage a broader range of their digital activities.  


The three most common pillars that consumers want to consolidate are shopping, travel and entertainment. Consumers who want a single way to interact across these three areas are generally less interested in transacting than in having a single, convenient place to assemble the data about those activities. These “information seekers” account for 20% of all adult consumers in the U.S. — some 53 million consumers.  


“Financial wellness seekers” account for 47 million U.S. consumers, or 18% of the adult population. These consumers see value in having a single place to access and manage their money in their various bank accounts and to make and receive payments.  


Data is based on a study of 3,166 consumers in the US between Oct. 27 and Nov. 8 2021."
