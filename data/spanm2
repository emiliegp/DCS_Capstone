"My 5 person startup gets thousands of loan applicants each month. I was wondering what’s the cost of l FICO (or any other credit bureaus) API per thousand customers/hits? It’s hard to infer from their website.

Please help! Thank you."
"[""I pay like 1.85 for XPN soft pulls and 2.85 or 3.15 for hard pulls. IIRC the API doesn't make the request more or less expensive, however I do believe volume impacts price per CBR.\n\nI do commercial equipment loans, so category falls under auto / specialty.\n\nWhat kind of pulls? Co-applicant tri-merge can be costly (and fun coding).\n\nCheck out an association or buying group for big discounts."", 'Whoa, really, lets talk. \n\nWe are in commercial equipment finance space and am considering a consumer product. 1000 apps is impressive. I was on the phone direct w Equifax this am but you may want to consider someone that sells 3rd party. There are a few I am thinking of. We are also a 5 person startup (front bench) though have a good 5-8 more people supporting in different ways.', '[deleted]', 'Hi, 3rd part can be easier and sometimes more affordable. We were talking to Equifax about a Proxy data set for training models. Can tell you more about pricing later. If you are doing $1,000 a month going direct to Equifax and Experian could make sense. They have all the APIs and seamless integration you could ever need though they do want you to $$ pay for it. There are a few other resellers out there you could consider as part of due diligence to double checks costs and functionality.\n\nI am really interested to find out more about your project and explore if there is any room for collaboration. We are working to build an instant decisioning system, if you have some experience with underwriting commercial equipment your your feedback could be valuable. \n\nI am interested how you are getting the 1000 apps if its call center or ads with roas etc']"
