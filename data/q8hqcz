"20 year old from India. I don't have technical/programming skills. But have some interest in finance and business. I like to analyse business and understand their moat. Along with it, I am interest in Corp finance and portfolio management. However, I wanna get a job at fintech because I strongly believe this decade belongs to fintech firms. 

Let's say I have 4 months to prepare so that I can break into fintech. What should I be doing? Which skillsets should I focus on? How to approach companies? How to start from basic?"
"['I would suggest going out for the SIE Exam. It is an exam built by FINRA. It is a co-requisite to the Series 7. The cool thing about the SIE Exam is you do not need to be sponsored by a firm to take it. Firm Sponsorship is required for all other FINRA Exams. If you are able to take and pass this exam and put it on your resume, Fintech firms will take you more seriously knowing you have that. If they have in house broker-dealer or Investment Advisor operations then they will greatly value you already having this.', 'Focusing on a particular compliance could be another way to go. Something like PCI DSS. \n\nUnpopular opinion is to become data compliance officer and go from there. Most of the FinTech companies suck with the data privacy. \n\nAnyway 4 months is tough. Focus on the lowest hanging fruit.']"
