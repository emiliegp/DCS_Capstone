"We have an idea to create a dividend account app. We need to get Eur deposits from people and return interest to them regularly. Interests are fluctuating regularly, it is a fund business so loss in balance is possible but quite unlikely.

If it’s a fund, what is the strategy?', 'The strategy of fund is turning fiat into crypto lending it and returning interest/returns to fund participants.\nIt is accessed through a phone app to simplify the deposit and withdrawal process and keeping track of balances', 'You will need permission to run a fund in some country to start with. Maybe check Luxembourg. Then you’ll need an administrator to validate your fund calculations. You will also need a number of people to hold formal positions on your board. All in all you should expect 100kEUR++ startup costs plus yearly costs. To make sure you actually do it right I would suggest contacting a lawyer or someone who knows the details.', 'Thanks what is 100k EUR for?', 'Mainly administrative costs for getting permissions.', 'Crazy, is it possible to reduce costs depending on which country you apply, Estonia, Latvia?!', 'Possibly. You’ll have to investigate. But most likely you’ll have to spend so much on lawyers that the administrative fee doesn’t matter anyway. A fund is _all_ about trust, so you rather have a professional-looking fund in Luxembourg than a cheap-ass fund in Estonia. In the end you want to attract capital. However, considering the mindset of crypto-investors, trust/due-diligence may not be of an issue…', 'There are many fintechs in northern countries yes Revolut. I am not trying to get institutional money.']"
