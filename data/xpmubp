"Hi fintech fam!

What is the best source to track card schemes mandates and updates? And other payment regulations to stay compliant. May be blog or newsletter?"
"['Same question here!', '""Card Schemes"" aren\'t a thing.   \n\n\n[PYMNTS.com](https://PYMNTS.com)  i guess.', '1. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card\\_scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Card_scheme)\n2. PYMNTS is a great news resource. But I am looking for more like a list of all new mandates / regulation in 2022 / 2023.']"
