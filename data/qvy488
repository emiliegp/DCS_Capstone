"[""Banks have 0 incentive to actually implement it. In any deal it has to be a win-win. In EU's case this regulation is just forced onto banks. Good for the industry, not so much for the banks.\n\nSame stuff that happened to telecom industry, where your cellular provider de facto became your internet provider. Telecoms adapted and merged with the entertainment and media segment.\n\nBanks are yet to find their angle in this."", ""Good article, but missed the main reason - data sharing would be a threat to incumbents' market share, and so they obviously do not wish to do that."", 'The name: it sounds like unlocked car or front door wide open.   \n\n\nPeople and organisations do not think about their financial assets & money as something that should be ""open"".   \n\n\nThat\'s not to say it\'s not a good idea, it is, but its branding is awful and often misunderstood by consumers.', 'Good observation', 'Actually it can be a revenue opportunity for them, they just choose to see it as a threat/compliance issue.', ""No, I think they nailed it. There's a big tech investment cost to build the api's for most banks. And they don't see the major value-add it could have for their customers or how it could bring in more deposits. So they aren't motivated."", 'This is actually a great point', 'Thanks Paul!']"
