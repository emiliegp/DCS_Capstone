Is it possible to track a foreign payment better?

"How does a government track foreign payments for a non-government organization for certain? I wonder about this because a person can send money from a foreign country to a domestic account A and then it can be transferred from one domestic A account to another domestic account B.

How could we know if the organization shows domestic account B as it's account?"
"['I think this would depend on if the account is registered as a company or personal account. If company it will fall under company laws. If personal I know with my local bank they will ask why you just got any large sum of money into it from abroad.', ""The bank will ask, but as for a non-government entity receiving the money into account B or anyone auditing the non-government organization, people won't know because they can only see bank account B is sending it to them."", 'Well in your example I think account a will be check by the bank to see the source of the incoming transfer and by moving it to another domestic account right away you will be subject to AML.', ""But say the bank wouldn't do this scrutiny. It's going from **foreign country --> domestic account A --> domestic account B --> NGO**\n\nHow can the NGO now be sure where it's source of money is coming from?""]"
