"I’m representing my private wealth SaaS fintech and looking to network at the event. I’m going alone to this one but it would be nice to know a few folks going at the event ahead of time. I always find it helpful network with other people, so as you have conversations, you can introduce each other and grow your network faster. 

Who’s going? What are you going for?"
"['I will be there as a representative of a financial services and data company. Would love to connect. I like the idea of networking in tandem!', 'Going to talk to vendors and potential partners.', ""I'll be there! Would love to meet up for coffee or at one of the happy hours if schedules works out since I'm heading there alone."", ""Awesome! I'll shoot you a DM."", 'I’ll shoot you a DM', 'Nice! I’ll shoot you a DM']"
