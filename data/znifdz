"Hello. I have recently qualified as a CMA, IMA, and I also have a BBA degree, and even though I like accounting I also want to include my hobby of software engineering to choose a career for myself. What job titles require those two skills and how should I proceed to get a job? Thank you."
"['You can be a software engineer who makes accounting software their niche. I’d recommend building a system or two and then using that as experience as well as boilerplate', ""They aren't as related as you might think. The only leg up an accounting education gives you, I think, is you could build a ledger system a little easier maybe. Unless you want to write accounting software or tax software. That's pretty specific though, in terms of career."", ""I am an accountant and have the exact same idea to build an accounting software that fits my needs more than old boring SAP. DM me if you'd like."", 'Do you know coding on Java??', 'I think so, but it depends…few specific type of softwares are generally built up on Java like LMS for banks and NBFCs. Try to create LMS and sell it to any new NBFC.', 'Thanks for the reply. Do you know what that post will be called? I am trying to search on Google for the type of job I want but cant name it properly.', 'No, python. Is Java better for accounting software?', 'There’s really not a particular name that I known of for it. It’s just software engineering. The closest you might be able to get to it is ‘financial software development/developer’']"
