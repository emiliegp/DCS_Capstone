"API Banking is appearing on web sites of most major banks. But very few of them have given more details of how to subscribe, what are the charges or is it free etc.

For one, on RBL Bank, I tried to register as an individual and tried subscribing to one of the APIs. The status is still shown as under process. Not sure whether it's just taking time or the service is not functional.

If some of you have any first hand experience of using APIs with any bank in India, could you please share."
"['Federal Bank has a bunch of APIs for account opening (as of now). Their APIs are embedded in Fi and Open apps. Check Federal Bank once...and also IDFC First Bank', ""I am looking for payment APIs mainly.\n\nIDFC bank portal talks about APIS, but no further details. Their staff has no idea (most don't know what API banking is).""]"
