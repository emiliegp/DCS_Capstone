"Hey guys !

I'm looking for people who recognize themselves in these 2 characteristics :

\- Saving money in traditional saving accounts (in your bank)

\- Interested in crypto but not enough time to dive in this field

If you recognize yourself I would love to hear from you because I'm building a product that you might like :)

Cheers"
"[""I do keep a good amount in savings amount though I regularly invest in an index as well (don't wanna throw everything into equity at once). \nI've seen people talking about how they've earned years worth of their salaries in crypto, but i feel like I'll just be following the crowd if I jump in right now without knowing everything through.""]"
