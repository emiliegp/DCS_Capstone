"Hello guys!   


I am making a pitch deck for start up competition at school and my idea is related to fintech and credit card but I am struggling getting financial projection as I can't find good info for credit card user Lifetime value. I found an article saying LTV is around $200 from interchange fee and interest but at the same time I also found a source saying average CAC is $150-$200 per card user.   


 So if that was the case no credit card would make money! I don't understand how fintech is so trendy with VCs if margin are so low!  


Could someone explain  ðŸ˜¬"
"['I\'m not 100% sure that this is the direction you are going, but this breaks it down a little more:  \n\n\n""The lifetime profit value of the customer is calculated by multiplying the total customer and referral lifetime sales by the gross profit margin. If the gross profit margin is 50 percent, the lifetime profit value of the customer including referrals is $75,000 x 50 percent, or $37,500. Even this may understate the total long-term value of the relationship because the referrals themselves can also make more referrals, further enhancing lifetime customer profit value.""\n\n[https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/the-lifetime-value-of-a-customer-scott-allen/](https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/the-lifetime-value-of-a-customer-scott-allen/)', 'LTV on credit is all over the board which is why you want to hone in on a segment that is either easy to acquire or spends a bunch of $$ over the life of the card.\nInterchange take as a non bank is about 2.2%. No idea what kind of returns are associated with the lending element (APR)']"
