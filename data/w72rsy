Collateral in payment systems

"In some payment systems banks are required to pledge collateral, often a very large sum, to protect the system in case the bank defaults. But there are alternative solutions to mitigate this risk. Do you happen to know the solution that utilizes push and pull technologies? My guess is that the solution is to make each bank have a bank-guarantor which will guarantee to pay the debt. But I don't know what these push and pull technologies would be about in this case. Push and pull transactions, maybe?"
"['Are you talking about ACH sponsor banks?', 'The fdic?', ""If you are a fintech or other payment platform that uses a bank's infrastructure they will make you post cash collateral against ACH volume. Think of it like a reserve requirement. You can either fund this with cash, Letter of Credit, or another liquid instrument. Hope that helps.  \n\n\nBanks likely have a federally regulated reserve requirement also."", 'No, sponsor banks just process debit and credit payments as far as I know. I mean an alternative to what is described in this [article](http://abc.az/mobile/view.php?id=97329&lng=ru)', ""Doubt so, it's payment systems themselves that collect these deposits. Maybe this [article](http://abc.az/mobile/view.php?id=97329&lng=ru) will make it clearer what I'm talking about"", 'That article you reference doesn’t really have much to do with push or pull payments. It highlight that any card program needs to have a reserve funding source so that the bank can always be whole with the federal reserve or similar banking systems. \n\nIt looks like as the card programs have been ramped down, the amount of working capital in the reserve isn’t necessary anymore so the banks can pull those funds out.', ""Yeah, I get that. But what I'm trying to understand is this:\nThese insurance (security?) deposits have a specific goal - to support the payment system. And have nothing to do with push or pull payments. But when, instead of this approach, payment system operator demands the other bank to vouch for the bank-newcomer, that is, guarantee to pay the debt the latter may have, is this somehow related to pull and push payments?"", 'Hard to understand your question.']"
