Question about debt on Blockchain
2022-09-24 03:37:59
"**Newbie question**

Is it possible to issue securitized debt products on Blockchain/DLT without tokenizing them?

Or a sort of tokenization is anyhow required?

The question is regardless the kind of infrastructure adopted (permissionless, permissioned, private, public).

It is not for the sake of whatever purpose, it is just a question to understand better the technology.

If I had to pick an answer I would say that the tokenization is required, however I am not an expert.

Hope my question was clear.

Thanks in advance to whoever is going to help me."
