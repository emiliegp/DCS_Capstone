Third-party for payment

"Hi, guys, I am looking for a solution to a payment problem. I would like to buy an Instagram username of a person who I messaged - is there a payment service that overlooks this as a third party for payment in case they try to scam me, i.e. I transfer the money, but they do not let go of the username? I think PayPal had a ""report a scam"" function, but I am not too sure."
"['I had similar idea of helping people to trade digital assets. where you become third party for doing and holding the payment until buyer and seller agrees.', 'Itâ€™s called a digital ESCROW service', 'https://www.stratuscore.com/digital-escrow.php']"
