"Just getting in touch because we think you might be interested in the event we're running for Fintech Week London.

The event features an expert panel answering the question 'How can technology answer the remaining questions in fintech?' Our panel consists of  Chris Skinner (The Finanser and author), Ritesh Jain (Fintech Founder & Advisor, CFTE), Genevieve Leveille (CEO & Founder of AgriLedger), Jacky Uys and moderator Andrew Vorster (Innovation Catalyst).

After the panel discussion there will be a networking session with free drinks and pizza free for all attendees.
