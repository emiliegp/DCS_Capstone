Tons of casebooks related to banking law, alone, can show banking is going to stay roughly where it is right now. A few things might change, but it won't be Uberized. \n\nAt most, an app is created that allows you to pick and choose banking services at a moment's notice. Similar to picking a cab, or an Uber-driver. \n\nHowever, the money still has to be stored somewhere, and someone needs accountability for the money. I trust Bank of America with my money more than I do someone that is a contractor for an Uber-type business. \n\nThis is CLICKBAIT!"", 'How long before there are no jobs?', 'So now Uncle Tony can run www.offersyoucantrefuse.com?', ""Except that banks are incredibly regulated.\n\nWhy is London still driven by thrice-annually-striking bullies? Because they can. Because tube drivers have rights enshrined in law. If it wasn't for such regulation promising tube drivers unfair rights you can bet they'd have been replaced by technology (driverless trains) a decade ago.\n\nBanking, similarly, is a spider-web of regulation. You can't just enter the finance industry and expect to join the big boys. You have to buy out an existing bank with the necessary licences - or pay lobbyists handsomely to procure new ones. Then you'll have to submit to a ton of regulation and audits.\n\nTechnology is great. But people do their darnedest to make it illegal - because those with the power sure as heck don't want the playing field to be level.

After using uber a few times I doubt it. \n\nFrom what I understand is uber is basically turning everyone into a contractor instead of a employee, which is cheaper for us because there are no rules guiding them and they don't need protections but it also means all those drivers are on the hook for everything and I'm not sure a lot of them realize it."", 'Creating jobs isn\'t very useful when those jobs barely pay a living wage after Uber takes their cut... which kind of defeats your ""more money for everyone else"" theory.', 'Random, unrelated question purely out of curiosity... \n\nIs english not your first language?', ""I would agree with you but a lot of cabs around me are not owned by the driver.

Just hard to tell sometimes because many people who do speak english as a first language are even worse at it than people who don't."", 'Ultimately Uber will get disrupted by the blockchain tech companies that can write programs to do everything Uber does without a corporate structure.\n\nThis way, drivers for this company keep 90% of the money rather than the small fraction they do with Uber\n']"
