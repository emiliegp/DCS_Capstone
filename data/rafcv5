Bank transactions data enrichment

"Hey,
what's the best bank transactions data enrichment solution based on the bank description for US based B2B/B2C?

Has anyone tried ntropy?"
"['MX is the only real answer. Some others are trying to get into the space and Yodlee/Plaid are changing their ways because of MX (plaid now advertises that they don’t sell data). So they are trying to improve data capabilities.\n\nSegmint is fucking garbage.', ""We're using Nordigen in the EU. Depends on exactly what kind of enrichment you are talking about (and in which country - works a lot better in some than others). But the merchant ID and general categorization does the job most of the time."", 'i think it depends on what type of enrichment you are looking for. MX for PFM like enrichment, flinks looks good for broad customer base analysis.', 'What’s your use case?', ""Ntropy is not that good IMHO. I dunno, the fact that you have to provide your own labels for them to even return any labels when you classify your BT, is kinda lame. And they also are very wrong when it comes to bank transfers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I'm just a a peasant, don't listen to me."", 'MX has been getting a lot of attention for this lately.', 'Ntropy is another option for classification.', 'Does any of you have any insights on pricing?', 'Pave.dev is the future. MX is wildly overpriced', 'IDVerifact - and FINTAINIUM.', 'I saw that they launched new products related to data enrichment etc. Did you try it out already? Is it good?', '""Most of the time"" ""depends on the country""\n\nYep, this.', 'Transaction classification for an accounting rules engine', 'Care to share  more? We work with them', 'Lol they are not new products, I think they just re-launched products that they had already... I didn\'t see anything ""new"" and we\'ve been using the transaction categorisation for a long time already (so that one I know for a fact is nothing ""new"")\n\nThere are really not many good options in Europe, Nordigen is at least basic-level acceptable.', 'A few more questions:\n\nB2C or B2B? \nHow granular do you want the categories? (E.g., Bill, Restaurant, Entertainment vs Merchant identification)\nWhat customer experience are you hoping to achieve after enriching the data?', 'Ntropy actually has outperformed anything else on the market for us in terms of this. Happy to make an introduction as well. They ship product super fast too so the improvement rate has been amazing   FYI we are building a tax automation engine on this end. Heard good stuff about Pave too, but they seem to be more focused on consumer.', 'B2B and merchant identification.\n\nI want to receive as much data as I can in order to be able to categorize transactions to the correct type of accounting account.', ""Like another comment mentioned, MX is probably not the best answer for your use case. There APIs skew towards B2C. That said, they are a major player and it's worth a convo. \n\nYou should also check out [Heron Data](https://www.herondata.io/) and [pave.dev](https://www.pave.dev/) and potentially [Spade](https://www.spade.dev/)\n\nPersonally, I've met one of the co-founders of Pave and really like what they are up to. I'd be happy to intro you if you'd like (PM me if so). \n\nOtherwise, good luck on the search!""]"
