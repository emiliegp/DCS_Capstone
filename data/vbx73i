" 

I have to choose a Finance concentration to graduate from school. The options are:

Financial Institutions, Corporate & International Financial Management, Real Estate, Insurance, & Investment & Financial Planning.

I am interested in getting into Fintech which concentration would be better suited for that?"
"['My best guess would be taking the financial institution course which exposes you to the structures & fundamentals of legacy and modern financial institutions giving you in-depth perspectives on challenges, opportunities and solutions in the financial industry which would be an important leverage when applying to fintech jobs.']"
