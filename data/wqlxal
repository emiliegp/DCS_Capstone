User testing a payments app

"Does anybody have good resources, vendors or best practices to share? I need more users to test our app. The 3rd party vendors we are exploring (eg User testing) canâ€™t help because our app requires their testers to provide PII to apply for a virtual card before they can start using the app. Any suggestions?"
"['Is there a list of specific personal information required by your app? The company I work for developed an internal tool for transaction testing, maybe we can assist, but I need to know what exactly PII you need?', 'Could you update your app so that there is a way to test the app w/o requiring users to provide real PII?', 'Yes! We are putting it in a sandbox environment that should be able to do the trick. Thanks guys!', 'Sounds great.  I created userbob.com to provide user testing at an affordable rate.']"
