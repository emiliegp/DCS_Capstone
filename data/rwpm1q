Bitcoin did well but some web2 companies did better in 2021.

"And after Bitcoin's bad start to 2022, [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/), [Apple](https://www.linkedin.com/company/apple/) and [Tesla](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tesla-motors/) have also beaten BTC in the past 12 months.  


When it comes to investing, it's hard to quibble with an annual return of 60%.  And yet Bitcoin holders earned lower yields in 2021 than one of the Web2 companies that crypto is trying to overtake: Alphabet.  


Bitcoin had a lackluster December, limping into the new year with 60% returns for 2021—its worst performance since 2018, when it lost roughly three-quarters of its value. (Investors can only hope for a down year like that again.) Though BTC has a $880 billion market capitalization, ranking eighth on CoinMarketCap's list of assets, in between Meta (FB) and Nvidia (NVDA) shares.  


But Alphabet, which has a market cap above Bitcoin's, nonetheless managed to beat it. Google's parent company watched its stock price rise 68% in 2021, per data from Google Finance, thanks to increased advertising revenue across its platforms, including YouTube.  


Other top-tier tech stocks also did well. [NVIDIA](https://www.linkedin.com/company/nvidia/), which makes chips for both video game devices and crypto mining rigs, gathered up 125% returns as supply chain problems boosted demand (and prices) for its products; its market cap is now above $750 billion.  


Computer company [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/) is up 54% over this time last year. Apple has registered 41% gains. And electric car maker [Tesla](https://www.linkedin.com/company/tesla-motors/), headed by Dogecoin fanatic Elon Musk, is now up 64% over the past 12 months.  


While cryptocurrencies and companies are different types of assets, comparing the numbers is instructive precisely because of their differences. Many stocks (though not Alphabet) pay regular dividends to shareholders.  


Moreover, stocks—even individual ones—can be incorporated into retirement accounts, meaning they have in-built tax benefits that make them more attractive to retail investors. Not so with Bitcoin, hence the demand for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund that trades like stocks on a traditional exchange.   


Of course, holders might object that these numbers are cherry picked—home in on another timeframe and the numbers might look completely different. After all, Bitcoin is known for going on epic tears.
