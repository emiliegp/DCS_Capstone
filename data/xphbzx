"Hello,

I’m currently a college senior about to attain their bachelors in manufacturing management which is a basically a mix of industrial engineering and business management. With my bachelors being completed soon I am looking to attain a masters degree in Financial Technology, which is a considerably different field than what I’m studying now.

Before starting this program I am looking to take a Financial Technology online course and to learn a coding language, python. Is there anything else I should prepare myself for to help me find success in this field."
"['Learning a coding language will send you down the software engineering path. It is pointless to take one class and then learn about other things.   \n\n\nIf you want to be a software engineer then focus on that. If you want to work in fintech as a PM then just do research on the industry.   \n\n\nFintech is not something you study in school. It\'s just an industry / sector.   \n\n\nTo put it in terms of your degree, you wouldnt go study ""cryogenic trunnion ball valve manufacturing"" if you want to make a valve. You would study manufacturing engineering and then research cryogenic / complex closed die forging, etc .   \n\n\nSame thing here. Fintech is not something you study and most programs are scams. Learn product management skills if you want to manage a product or learn how to code if you want to be a software engineer. Then get a job and READ about fintech topics. Don\'t waste the money on a fintech program.   \n\n\n  \nContext: I am an exec in the consumer fintech space with over $75M raised', ""I'd learn typescript over python. Both ideally. So you want to be a developer or are you wanting to be something more like a product manager or customer liaison?"", 'This is some great insight, thank you for your reply', 'More like a product manager/customer liaison.\n\nSide note: I’m currently working as a quality engineering technician at a medical device company', 'A course on Agile would be good in this case.  Maybe design thinking or something in user research too.', 'https://www.pmi.org/certifications/project-management-pmp']"
