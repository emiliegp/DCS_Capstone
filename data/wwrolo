Refinancing rates for Fintech lenders from credit/debt funds
2022-08-25 04:59:37
"Hey guys. Can anyone knowledgeable please comment what is the ballpark refinancing rate charged by credit funds providers to fintech lenders who focus on developed markets and lend to SMEs via simple products such as factoring and revolving credit lines (business overdrafts) for terms of up to 12 months? I am fairly certain on the deal structure and funding that would be in place (via an SPV) but a bit fuzzy on pricing.   


I will very glad for any pointers."
