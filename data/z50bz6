"I have an idea that involves phone geolocation and the credit card industry. Are there any particular laws or regulations I ought to be aware of to make this work, or any ideas where I can look?

"[""You haven't given any information at all, so it's hard to say!"", 'He is trying to do some geolocation based security check for issuers. Or maybe he is trying to make a better transactions visualization experience. Idk about regulations but asking retail bank users to authorize location services on devices is not successful all the time.', 'Are you trying to map every merchantId and thus generate location history graph given a transaction history?  Provide some real-time geofencing? Detect place of work, place of residence, place of worship and most favorite grocery shop?\nIf so your idea is at least two decades old.\n\nTruly novel ideas are super rare in fintech. If you have something else in mind and your idea actually is novel, then hold on to it.', 'Lots of apps are already geolocation data for card controls and fraud prevention.', ""Aot of issuers have done this for years assuming it's for fraud, discover did a really interesting use case on it.  With that said, if you mixed it with rewards and data analytics it could be super interesting"", 'Maybe the way to go is to create a database adding georeferences to that vendors IDs.', 'insightful, thx', 'Yes, this isnâ€™t a new idea at all.', "">discover did a really interesting use case on it.\n\nWhat's the use case if you don't mind me asking?"", 'What about cars not present transactions']"
