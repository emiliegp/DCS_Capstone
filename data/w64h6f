"Hi folks!

I’ve been working as a UX Researcher in Financial Services and FinTech for the last 10 years or so. 

Is there any interest here from people working in the industry for help, guidance, insights into that sort of thing? How specifically to conduct research with customers in FinTech, what kinds of questions to ask, how to get good product feedback, etc.?

I realize this is a bit promotional, but I figured I’d start by asking if there’s any interest here. And if yes: what are some of the most important customer behavior questions folks in the industry want to understand?"

And most recently a 5 week longitudinal, between-group pilot study measuring the tool’s impact on risk taking and spending behavior.', 'That’s a super impressive amount of research!\n\nI suppose one way I’d try to help is to ask how you’re prioritizing the feedback you’ve gathered, and weaving it back into the development work?']"
