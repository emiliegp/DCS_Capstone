"For some background information, I am a male in my early/mid 20's. I graduated with a bachelors in finance and am about to pursue a masters in fintech. I am licensed and currently work in the front office of a large financial firm. I am targeting fund management or IB but I am unsure of the steps to make that leap. I am specifically looking for ideas for relevant internships (Spring or Summer 2023) that can help me get there. Any suggestions?"
