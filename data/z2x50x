"If you are offered services by an advisor who will introduce your fintech to potential refinancing partners to raise a line of credit with them, what would be a fair success-based compensation structure for such service? The services that individual will be providing is pure introduction to her network of investors - negotiations, deal structuring etc is all on us. Will be very grateful for any experience-based inputs."
"[""For debt it's typically a couple percent."", 'too high.   \n\n\n50bps is normal. If you have an advisor I would hope you are raising at least $10M']"
