what are some of the best universities in UK for Msc Fintech. i heard that University of Nottingham has a good course structure but the fees for international students is pretty high.
"['Hey, it would be interesting to think about the background you currently have and what role you want to get out of your MSc. As someone who has done an MSc in business and then working in fintech, I would definitely say there are ways to learn FS/FS related tech without formal study e.g. a lot of companies do an academy or internship. Feel free to message me if you want any advice 👊🏻']"
