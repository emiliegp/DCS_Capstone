How does Zilch make money?

"Hey beautiful people!

Can anyone please explain how does Zilch unicorn make money apart from attracting huge venture rounds and being a fancy app in the hot as hell industry?

Thatâ€™s the interchange fee from credit cards. Thatâ€™s the Â£2.5 fee if you wanna buy elsewhere from the partner stores. I get it. Thats the # of times they manage to turn around the books. Clear.

The bit which is not clear is how are they making money from the affiliate programmes?

Thanks for your inputs, folks!

Safe!"

Alternatively, if the merchants don\'t want to get on board, they charge you 11.5% APR. (just under half of a traditional credit card APR).', 'Anyone? ðŸ˜„']"
