"According to [Thomson Reuters](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thomson-reuters/), Egypt's three biggest state-owned banks are setting up an $85 million financial technology fund that aims to accelerate innovation in the sector, venture capital firm [Global Ventures](https://www.linkedin.com/company/global-ventures-me/), a partner in the fund, said on Sunday.  


Legislative and regulatory changes in Egypt over the last two years have paved the way for a surge in fintech investments and a change in the way the country's largely unbanked citizens do business, industry players say.  


[Banque Misr](https://www.linkedin.com/company/banque-misr/) will act as an anchor investor in the programme, with [National Bank of Egypt (NBE)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/national-bank-of-egypt/) (NBEGPT.UL) and [Banque du Caire](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bdcegypt/) ([BQDC.CA](http://bqdc.ca/)) as strategic investors, said the statement by Global Ventures, which focuses on the Middle East and Africa.  


[eFinance Investment Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/efinance-investment-group/), a state-controlled payments firm, and [Egyptian Banks Company](https://www.linkedin.com/company/egyptian-banks-company/), a payments operator led by the central bank, will also participate. The fund, called [Nclude](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ncludefund/) by Global Ventures, hopes to attract additional participation from regional and international investors, it added.  


The statement quoted Egyptian central bank governor Tarek Amer as saying the fund's establishment was ""a crucial step to transform Egypt into a regional centre for the fintech industry in the Arab World and Africa.""  


The fund has already made preliminary investments in four companies, it said.  


These are [Khazna](https://www.linkedin.com/company/khazna/), a financial app that provides products to underserved consumers; [Lucky App](https://www.linkedin.com/company/lucky-app/) , which offers instalments, cashback rewards and credit to consumers; [Mozare3 | مُزارع](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mozare3/), which provides small farmers with input financing, markets and technical support; and [Paymob](https://www.linkedin.com/company/paymobcompany/), a digital payment provider.
