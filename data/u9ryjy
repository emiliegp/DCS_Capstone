What’s the difference between a corporate card and a commercial card ?

"So I had this interview with a leading bank where this was the question posed to me. I was under the impression that a corporate card and a commercial card are the same, but it seems they are not. Can someone here help me find the right resource to get the difference. I did try google but didn’t get anything tangible.

Thanks in advance !"
"['there is no difference. I have been selling commercial/corporate cards for 15+ years at various issuers. Which issuer asked you this question? Seems like asking a question like that in an interview is a waste of time in my opinion.', 'My two cents:  commercial card is for purchasing departments.  Corporate card is for travel and expense.   We have both at our company.  My T&E card can’t be used for purchasing material or paying vendors.  It can only be used for travel and ancillary expenses.  Our “Commercial” cards are referred to as “P-Cards”', 'Ok... so in a nutshell, commercial cards are used for creating a revenue. Whereas corporate cards are used for spending, i.e. no revenue is generated directly from it.\n\nIs my understanding correct?', 'Sorry to chime in again on this but these definitions are being a bit over engineered. \n\nPlease note the tone of the post is of good spirits. The nomenclature of this industrying can by very confusing so no judgement. \n\nI have been selling these products for the last 15+ years so I am going to give you the complete low-down. Please bear with me:\n\nWhen you see ""Commercial card"" or ""Corporate card"" = corporate liability. i.e. the card issuer is going to underwrite the company\'s financials. Said another way, a corporate/commercial card program is simply a card program that is not personally backed by an individual from a liability perspective.\n\nWhen you see the word ""business"" (i.e. ""Amex Open"" or ""Spark small business"" or ""Amex Small Business"" or ""Chase Ink business"") = personal liability. i.e. there is a primary cardholder and that person is liable to pay the card program. \n\nI say all of that just to say that there is no difference between a ""commercial card"" and a ""corporate card"". It is just the industry using two different words to say ""a card program offered by an issuer where the liability is not personally tied to an individual"".\n\nThat is it. Nothing more to it... think vase/vase or tomato/tomato (I admit that analogy doesn\'t work that well on paper)\n\nok. now that you know what a corporate/commercial card is, now we can talk about the various types of corporate/commercial cards:\n\nP-card/purchasing cards = these are cards held by individuals to make online purchase, orders, etc. Often these are held by individuals in the purchasing department. They often have some extra controls that the company will use to help prevent enforce company purchase policies, prevent misuse and limit fraud. i.e. single purchase, daily, weekly, purchase limits and even the ability to lock down merchant category codes. P-cards are not used to pay invoices... they are used to make purchase so a company can avoid being invoiced all together.\n\nT&E cards = For all intents and purposes, T&E cards are very very close to the same thing as purchasing cards but the issuers will just tailor the controls more around travelers needs to help with expense reporting, etc.  Also, issuers will provide some extra coverage to those cards like rental insurance, airport lounge access, etc.\n\nVirtual cards = Same card issuer rails but no physical plastic is issued which makes these things very dynamic.  Most issuers offering virtual cards have the functionality to limit/allow these virtual card to be used as single-use, static, exact-amount, upto a specified amount, etc. Often issuers will pitch this as the best solution to their clients because it can be a way for the AP department to reduce paper checks and pay some of their invoices with single-use exact-amount virtual cards. This results in the company getting those points/cash back that they love but also make recon a lot easier compared to having the AP department trying to look at a credit card statement at the end of each month.  The main reason for this is due to the fact each invoice is paid with a unique 16 digit card number and once it is posted/settled by the merchant/vendor that card number can no longer be used which more closely mirrors the behaviors and rocon of a paper check. Think one to one trace data vs where paying vendors/invoices with a static card number results in a more laborious recon effort.\n\nHopefully this helps but I am happy to clarify anything or answer any other questions.', 'Mostly.  We can buy supplies with it that are expendable or even equipment that has nothing to do with revenue. For example, paying for janitorial supplies or the computer backup bill.', 'Thank you so much for the detailed explanation. Could you please elaborate on the below statement as to what ""pay invoices"" means...\n\n>P-cards are not used to pay invoices... they are used to make purchase so a company can avoid being invoiced all together\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for your help again!', 'Larger companies typically have a Purchasing department and an Accounts Payable department.\n\nLet me give an example:\n\nWhen a company wants to buy a stapler the buyer has a couple of options.\n\nThe buyer can go onto [staples.com](https://staples.com) and use a purchase card (or any card for that matter) to make payment... or... the buyer can order the stapler on their [staples.com](https://staples.com) account and just wait for an invoice to come in.\n\nWhen that invoice is received by the company it goes to the Accounts Payable department to be reviewed, matched to the purchase order and then paid.\n\nThat payment in that 2nd option is what I mean when I say ""pay invoices"".', 'Thanks!']"
