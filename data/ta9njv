Mortgage for self employed
2022-03-10 02:00:48
"Background: I'm building a mortgage company that lends to self employed . My MVP generated $7M of leads last month.

I'm looking to see if anyone has any background in the lending space. 

Here's what I want to do: Originate loan myself using custom underwriting algo. Hold and service the loan internally. So instead of selling the loan to investors as many lenders do, we are the investor and therefore we can underwrite the loan to our terms rather than external investor criteria. 

This practice happens in the industry already by a handful of banks/ credit unions at the moment, so it's not completely foreign however there are definitely some regulatory/compliance challenges involved in building something like this. 

Has anyone built or worked in the lending side of financial services? Any advice?"
"[""Banks/CUs can just hold long duration loans on balance sheet to offset the liabilities from their depository accounts, but also have access to cheap federal capital. \n\nIf you're a start-up fintech lender, retaining your loans is a very inefficient use of your capital.\n\nBesides, investors usually don't provide underwriting criteria - rather, they look at a platform's historical originations and the collections on those originations, determine where they perceive the risk to be based on that historical performance, and bake in the criteria to their debt facility/flow purchase agreement. Alternatively - if you underwrite to FNMA/FHLB criteria, you'd have a natural buyer for your originations. You can build your underwriting model to augment FNMA/FHLB guidelines and still build out your own underwriting model.\n\nIn other words, coming up with your own underwriting model, whether AI/ML based or just a standard statistical model, will be a must in building out a fintech lending platform, regardless of whether you retain those loans or sell those loans to investors."", 'I did financial models for CDOâ€™s and MBS, trading, accounting, tax accounting, IO, PO options, etc, etc \n\nPackage up your loans and sell them, cash in, cash out, rinse, repeat.', 'First of all, congrats on building the leads machine.

Usually securitization issuers have quite a bit of origination and performance history for rating agencies to be comfortable enough with certain ratings for anchor investors (which will be the main driver of your cost of capital). Usually to get to that degree of volume, lenders usually get revolving warehouse lines first.

The first thing that should be worked on from a commercial perspective is that gaining of trust in the market. I do see you have some leads coming in. Are they turning into customers, is the entity profitable (etc, etc, default questions) ? (if so commercially you're in optimal shape)\n\nThen, if you want to build custom IT, pick a good tech person, preferably someone with 20+ years experience as mathematician/something related, who will be tough to work with perhaps as they have their own opinion about the world and the lending space (e.g. they normally don't really enjoy talking with commercial people!).\n\nComing back to my original statement, the goal is to understand what the market wants  first and then to build IT.

(if you're allowed to say)\n\nI'd also recommend Cross River Bank, and also be ready to give up some equity warrants for working with the likes of SVB and CRB. \n\nKeep in mind that the way warehouse lines work, is that you'd have to originate the loans first, then post those loans as collateral, then draw from those warehouse lines (though it sounds like you're already aware of the mechanics)."", 'Thanks! Sent you a message! Looking forward to connecting.', ""Yes, the MVP that generated 7M in leads converted to about 5M in closed/en-route to close. \n\nBeen reaching out to banks/capital partners and there's a LOT of red tape.

Current systems/processes aren't providing an easy way for self employed folks to get a mortgage. \n\nI'm looking for a capital partner that will allow me to do the underwriting (non-delegated) and also do servicing (servicing retained). \n\nProblem is that I don't have a track record or underwriting system built so it's not like I can convince them yet or pitch it to them.   \n\n\nWould love to jump on a call with you and run through the issues I'm seeing as I could write an essay on here.
