"Hi all,

what is your opinion on VC-fueled banking starutps?   


I'm following a fintech newsletter ([https://fintechwave.substack.com/](https://fintechwave.substack.com/)), and today they wrote about Atom Bank from UK. Anyhow, to cut things short, Atom Bank even though they are a private company, published an annual report.

  
Their results?  


The bank has 123.000 customers and Â£3.2B in savings balances. In terms of finances, the bank has Â£46.8M of revenue and a loss of Â£9.1M. 

But all of this doesn't stop them from raising new funding next year. The target for a new funding round is Â£50 mil.   


What are your thoughts on this? Would you open an account with them?"
"['Iâ€™d open it if the money will be FDIC insured or insured by a govt body', 'I am more interested in the infrastructure powering the banks such as Synctera.com or platforms enabling banks to compete with the digital/bro banks suck as Bankingly.com. \n\nThe neo banks are going to distrust traditional banks the same way digital publishing took down traditional media empires. My 11year old son will never go into a bank, and will most likely use an Atom or CopperBank as a teenager.', 'Just like with the ""Be your own Bank"" mantra we have going with money these days. We also have a slew of ""We\'ll be your new bank"" type organizations all promising the different things while offering the same.', 'It is, their accounts are FSCS insured (FDIC equivalent).']"
