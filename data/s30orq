Gen Z doesn't need open banking!?

"Open banking — the infrastructure that allows banks to share users’ financial data — is primed to be one of the standout innovations in fintech in the next few years. The UK government has put its weight behind it, investment has poured in and it now powers around 4m UK users.  


Yet open banking (OB) has also proven divisive. Most recently, [Anne Boden](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAWSniYBLDg3Glx_y50BvY8moC6p7AsNztE), the founder of [Starling Bank](https://www.linkedin.com/company/starlingbank/), provoked an angry public letter after calling it a flop.   


Now fintechs targeting Gen Z — under 25-year-olds — are also weighing in, telling [Sifted](https://www.linkedin.com/company/siftedeu/) they aren’t leveraging open banking or clear about the benefits of it for younger demographics.   


Christian Lüscher, who heads up marketing at Swiss-based challenger bank Yapeal and Yapani, a digital account for kids aged seven up, is also unconvinced. Kids don’t traditionally use multiple bank accounts, he explains, limiting the utility of integrating open banking.  


Crucially, this means the young, digital-first generation aren’t being exposed to OB early on.  


One issue for the adoption of open banking is finding “the killer use case”.  


That applies to getting Gen Z on board too, says [Søren Nielsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAD2Qj8Bj3kW6E7lkcJukIj3CBiYk0uaCl0), chief commercial officer at [Subaio](https://www.linkedin.com/company/subaio/), a Danish software solution for banks. He argues Gen Z will only adopt open banking if there is an incentive for them to do so.  


“They will ask the question ‘Why? Why should we do that? Why should we give the bank, the fintech or whoever is asking us to do so access to our data unless it gives us something in return?’,” he says.   


Moreover, Gen Z is disproportionately primed for financial apps. Gen Z faces the biggest financial challenges of the future — from soaring house prices to frequent job changes to rising costs of living — says [Dan Scholey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAAAA1dbMBrL4CeRezfIhTBqJIZTu1XkY9S_M), CPO of open banking startup [MoneyHub](https://www.linkedin.com/company/moneyhub-id/).   


“The younger generation is in a unique position. While they are expected to inherit record amounts in the future, they face significant financial challenges at this moment,” says Scholey.   


As a result, open banking could be crucial for them by automating and promoting healthy financial habits.  


What use cases of open baking for Gen Z do you see?"
"[""Open banking enables a lot of innovation in the banking sector. The multitude of budgeting and banking apps are the best proof of it. Then there is HMRC's Open Banking rollout that will do more to promote Open Banking than any FinTech could."", 'What even is this?\n\nYeah, no shit pre-teens aren\'t getting much benefit from open banking. But as soon as you\'re old enough to start using more complex financial apps, it\'ll become _way_ more useful.\n\nOP, when you post this on your Substack, make sure you say I said ""this is fucking obvious"". And send me a link to the newsletter if you can.', 'Of course they aren’t. I don’t remember using anything more than a checking account between the ages of 16 and 24, and that was mostly just  for direct deposit and paying bills. Wait until those people are nearing 30; if they’re still not using these services, _then_ it’ll be something worth talking about', ""I wouldn't consider budgeting or banking apps to be innovative.""]"
