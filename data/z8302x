Contacting CFOs (and getting a reply back!)

"I am seeking an efficient method of initial contact for a startup.

Currently, we're in the growth stage. Sending out cold emails to CFOs yields minimal return for the time investment. 

Any CFOs that can chime in on what your preferred method of communication would be? 

Thank you in advance!
