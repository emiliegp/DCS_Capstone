Career: Central Bank Fintech Department job interview
2022-08-29 03:25:00
"Hi all,

I was emailed today for a job interview in my countryâ€™s central bank Fintech department. I was not told the position but my experience is mostly in Treasury and Asset Management. Crypto is prohibited in my country but thereâ€™re rumours that theyâ€™ll regulate it and allow it by next year and itâ€™ll be handled by this department. These are rumours but it has some truth to it I believe. Any recommendations how I should prepare for this interview tomorrow?

TIA"

The rumours might be true but you need to understand what role you will be applying for. You cannot prepare for an interview if you donâ€™t know what you been interviewed for.', 'Itâ€™s not ðŸ˜‚', 'Yeah am just reading up about Fintech just in case as itâ€™s in 12hrs, they said theyâ€™ll disclose it during the interview']"
