Learnings on starting a personal finance company
2021-10-29 18:51:40
"In the past 1.5 year I have been working on a general thesis that there is a big problem in financial planning and financial decision making for people. We have access to investing and the markets more than ever but still the question of ""Am I making the right decision"" in planning and asset allocation persists. All personal finance tools can visualize or track things but can not help you make an optimal decision the way a private banker or an advisor helps their clients make better decisions on wealth management.

The market is huge:

So we wanted to build a software product for people in 50-95% wealth or high-earners-not-rich-yet to help them with decision making. We identified decision making is a pain point. Here is the result of a survey from individuals: 

[People use lots of tools, but they still lack confidence in their decision making.](https://preview.redd.it/o9qzhg277cw71.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=98df769f9bcc9f4cff417f95551982dabc76f0da)

Our product solution was a financial modelling tool that is basically an income statement / balance sheet projection model. The idea is to project people's various assets and net worth over time and show them how various decisions can impact their goals.

In a sense this is similar to other financial planning tools such as [Money Guide Pro](https://www.moneyguidepro.com/ifa/) that financial planner use to visualize and show their client their plan. There are also lots of free tools and calculators that brokerages and banks have. I know people saying Schwab has a good one. 

During our customer discovery I realized another small group of people who are building a very similar tool [https://projectifi.io/](https://projectifi.io/) . This is very similar functionally to what I had in mind. Here is a screenshot.

Although they launched recently, their growth doesn't seem very fast. They have 67 people on their discord. I assume a few hundred users after 6 months. Nice growth but far from a product-market fit.

&#x200B;

So here you can evaluate many of our assumptions

\- What are people's pain point around planning and financial decision making? Are they willing to pay for it?

\- What is the core value prop in a product? I don't think a projection model with lots of nubs, assumptions and adjustments is really a winning product. Maybe finance geeks or advisors like it but not regular people.

\- How to make the product viral? Cost per customer acquisition for financial planning/advisory is very high (financial planning keywords are $20 per click on Google Search) People tend not to pay for information and knowledge so LTV would be low. That is a recipe for failure...

&#x200B;

Anyhow, just wanted to share my thoughts. I appreciate any feedback you might have on the idea or assumptions. If you are interested in this topic I am also happy to connect and chat."
"['First question I have, and it relates to the core value prop you mentioned - does anyone really need yet another AI driven analytical tool to help them make financial decisions? Is there enough value there that they can’t get somewhere else for free? \nFollow it up with do you feel people will trust your new app / AI to guide them and make consequential decisions which affect their future?  I think this is the real challenge when applying fintech to new market segments. \nYour analysis is on point with the questions especially around LTV. \n\nIs this a daily use tool? Weekly? Monthly?  How do you keep them engaged? \n\nIt’s a good challenge to try to solve! More power to you for making it happen, especially in a space where it’s mostly lead generation for other services.  Can your data analysis be more of a data aggregation and transformation tool which preps  the clients  for human financial advisors?  Just spit balling ….', 'I’m building https://mygraph.ca. It’s focused on analytics for your spending (but plan to broaden the scope).\n\nA large pain point for any of these products is still having 100% accurate info integrated. People don’t care about the tooling if they know the underlying data is < 100% accurate and comprehensive.\n\nThis is something I think about a lot and am aiming to solve with my product.', 'This', 'Great questions. On the most important one that is the pain point, do people need a tool to help with decision making? I think the answer is yes. There are tons of information and free stuff but absorbing them in your head and finding relevant info is not easy. Then you can go to an advisor who basically their job is to know all that knowledge and to guide you but this cost too much and the quality of service is not always the best either. \n\nIt is funny that you mentioned AI, because I tried to avoid mentioning it due to the fact that the first solution can be done without any real AI but good ole financial modelling and accounting algebra. If we build a AI chatbot to pretend to be a financial advisor, I agree people will not trust it and its dead on arrival. However, if we build an intuitive tool say a digital twin of their financial life in which people can see the outcome of their decisions, this will have a better chance of being recommended to their friends and family. To be returned to for making any major or minor decisions, and for them to check their wealth and finances on the monthly basis.\n\nThe aspect of this tool as B2B2C is also interesting, human financial advisors use very basic and outdated tools so there is an opportunity to make a product that is a companion to the financial advisor e.g. communicates the implication of decisions, show alternatives and allow the user to play with the tool and come up with good questions to ask the advisor, rather than starting from scratch.', 'This is a cool tool. However, have you considered how you would grow your user base? Apps like Mint, where successful many years ago because there were pioneers of content marketing. Those strategies does not work anymore. \n\nEven if a group of people really enjoy this product, cost for finding them and converting them to customers would be very large. However, if you are a single perseon doing this on the side, it may get to a modest success. Good luck!', 'Currently 1 person doing this on the side,🙏 for modest success.\n\nCurrently getting 1-2 signups per day from word of mouth now that I have a small base of users and the product generally works.\n\nStill focusing on product improvements and haven’t thought a ton about user acquisition yet but interested in others thoughts and experience.', 'If you are getting word of mouth, that is great. You just need a viral factor more than 1. Meaning if 1 person on average suggest to more than another person, this would grow exponentially!']"
