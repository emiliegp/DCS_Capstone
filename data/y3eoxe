"In light of Elon Musk’s announcement of X being an ‘everything’ super app, most people believe that this is a bad idea. Forget the antitrust issues, people think that switching between apps is not such a big deal and a ‘Swiss Army Knife’ of apps is something that people don’t really want.

Does this opinion also fit within fintech? Is there a case for a super app within fintech? If not, what would be better to address the current issues that consumers are currently facing with fintech?"
"['Elon will make it work somehow. He always does. \n\nSuper apps work well within antiquated & fragmented spaces like homeownership for example. The journey from when one thinks of buying a home all the way to selling & everything in between like home maintenance, tapping home equity, renovations, etc…', 'Monzo <3']"
