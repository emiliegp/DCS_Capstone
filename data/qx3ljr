" If you are a company in the fintech industry involved in the data collection, analysis and process control, this might be of use.

The pressure to quickly summarize, search, or catalogue financial documents is at an all time high—the amount of unstructured data that often needs manual structuring grows at a high rate each year.

We believe in empowering quicker decisions and faster processes in order to best serve individuals and businesses. For this reason, here at [UBIAI](https://ubiai.tools), we are looking to provide our consultation services free of charge to a few key businesses in order to help design an AI pipeline that automates document processing and information extraction.

If you’re interested in learning more, please DM or contact us at [admin@ubiai.tools](mailto:admin@ubiai.tools)"
