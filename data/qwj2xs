"Hello all, I have just finished a front-end course and Iâ€™d like to move into FinTech. I know the right languages have frameworks but because I havenâ€™t got a computer science or related degree Iâ€™m having a hard time even getting my CV forwarded to FinTech companies. I was advised to work on building data rich, data algorithms within JS. Does anyone know of any tutorials or resources I can use for this?"
"['Iâ€™d recommend to focus on building up your GitHub profile of integrating bunch of different FinTech APIs into a slick UX. \n\nJust take Plaid, Alpaca and others and build simple MVPs. Take designs from Dribbble or Behance and build a bunch of frontends for neobanks, trading interfaces, dashboards, charts, analytics interfaces. \n\nGet really good at it. Once you build 10+ projects, continue building and start participating in the open source projects to get your code reviewed (style, formatting, readability, quality, guidelines, tests, architecture). \n\nKeep doing this for a year and you stand a chance to land a job.', ""Hello there!
