"Every new finance app out there like truebill or YNAB that uses plaid to get AMEX data in works for about 4-5 days and then just stops working, so I've quit using just about every app out there. 

They recommend deleting the integration and recreating it, but thats not really acceptable. 

Anyone else had this experience?"
"['Teller is quite stable for us on several projects. \n\nMX did the job too. \n\nYou can check others here:\n\nhttps://www.awesomefintech.com/category/open-banking/', 'Yes, this is one of the main reasons I built https://mygraph.ca. Was tired of Mint and YNAB having messed up data because of flakey account linking.', 'MX keeps connection with Amex a lot longer than others.']"
