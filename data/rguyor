Plaid vs MX vs Akoya vs other bank data aggregators

"Hey guys,

I'm looking for the most reliable bank transactions aggregator in the US market at the moment, for an accounting service.

I've used Plaid and had encountered some issues. Some data was missing, some had mistakes and more.

I've read a bit about Akoya, MX and the rest but still don't know which service is the most reliable at the moment.

Which one, from your experience is the most reliable?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
"[""I've been watching Plaid's APi performance and it seem to be in the orange/red a lot. Finextra recently offered an API monitor for free. [https://www.finextra.com/open-banking-apis/](https://www.finextra.com/open-banking-apis/)"", 'We looked at plaid and Yodlee in the past. We were pretty grossed out by the business model. I work for an FI and MX was the best choice. I have to be a steward of my consumers data. Aggregation and IAV is fine if users are willing to turn it over, but I didn’t want to be a party to Plaid or Yodlee selling my consumers data to third parties. It’s a scummy business model, even if their API docs were easier to consume. I understand that they have changed their business models to not selling data now. Culture matters. MX has integrity. Others can make their own assumptions.\n\nSo I went with MX for IAV and data for a project. We already had a relationship with PFM. Their data enhancement is top notch and they are the best people to work with. Every interaction with anyone from MX has been nothing short of stellar. I’ve been to a few of their events. I met Brandon Dewitt twice and was sorry about his passing. \n\nAny FinTech or FI would be shooting themselves in the foot if they went with Plaid, Yodlee, Akoya, or Finicity over MX.', ""We use Plaid and MX a lot, personally I like quality and stability of MX more.\n\nWe also started using Teller for some extra US banks where MX/Plaid provide less APIs.\n\nHere's the list of similar vendors:\n\nhttps://www.awesomefintech.com/category/open-banking/"", 'Try out Nordigen, good alternative to Plaid   \nhttps://nordigen.com/en/', '[Pave.dev](https://Pave.dev)  \n\n\nMX is overpriced', ""Hi, I work at Plaid and if you're willing to share, I'd love to learn more about the issues you were experiencing so we can address them. If you haven't already filed a support ticket, please feel free to DM me with details about the data you were missing or found to be incorrect so I can pass it on to the Transactions and Data Extraction teams!"", 'what kind of accounting service?', 'As a consumer who was apparently effected by the [plaid lawsuit](https://www.plaidsettlement.com/frequently-asked-questions.php) and is now having to consider whether or not to use apps based on their backend, thank you for looking out for us.', 'You are welcome. Someone *should* speak up for end users beyond edit: litigation. It\'s called ""doing the right thing."" \n\nAnd u/phoenixy1 your sales reps were talking to me last week. They were talking shit on MX and spouting off on things that your team is clueless about. But that is reflective of your culture which lacks integrity. My MX rep and the team has NEVER spoken badly about Plaid except about what was true - You sold anonymized data on my end users and you got caught. \n\nKeep up talking like that to a potential buyer about a company that has shown nothing but integrity and a track record of doing the right thing. It shows fear of competition and insecurity about your own offerings. Plaid is going to get sued with that nonsense, or at least a cease and desist from your competition.']"
