Sending money to the wrong person using a P2P app that uses cellphone numbers instead of bank accounts

"Have this ever happened to you? Zelle, PayPal, Venmo, all these apps let you transfer money to people using either their cellphone numbers or email addresses; however, if you send money to the incorrect person, there is a possibility you won’t get your money back. These mistakes are usually because the user typed the incorrect cellphone/e-mail or because the incorrect contact information is saved (old cellphone numbers, for example).

I have read the FAQs of mostly all these apps and they all address this issue the same way: you have to send the recipient a “charge back”, contact the recipient on your own and pray he answers/gives you your money or call the bank to see if they can act as a third person and contact recipient, but none of these solutions are guaranteed. 

If this has happened to you, can you think of a way this issue can be solved? In my opinion, waiting for it to happen is not the best way to handle this. My goal is to find a way to avoid this from happening from the beginning. Any thoughts?"
"['Im personaly paranoid when using Zelle for this reason. I find using Email is much better than phone numbers as email addresses are not recycled frequently, if at all. Even then, I double check with the recipient before hand.', 'I worked for an up and coming BillPay provider for a while that also provided P2P. I can’t speak specifically for Zelle and PayPal (I know venmo actually asks you to verify the last 4 digits of the receiver’s cell phone number if they aren’t a contact in your phone)\n\nMy old company outsourced the rails and a little functionality of the P2P transaction to a company called Acculynk. A lot FIS based products are starting to use it since FIS bought them a few years ago. \n\nAnyway, Acculynk has a nice little feature to help with this. There’s a security question that you can input as almost a secondary check. Say I send my friend $10 to cover lunch. My question could be “Where did we eat lunch today?” Then I also input the answer to the security question as “Fish Market”. To receive funds, the receiver has to answer the question correctly. \n\nYou’ll find Acculynk’s functionality within some mobile banking apps. Depending on who your bank and/or bill pay provider chooses. \n\nThis may not immediately solve your issue but depending on who you bank with, this may be an option.', 'This happened to me the first time I used Venmo. I think it was before PayPal acquired them. Their official response was that I had to ask the guy to send it back and to let them know if he wouldn’t. Luckily, he did.', 'I totally understand you! 😂😂😂 I double check the cellphone numbers when I send money, even if they’re saved. 😅 But there has to be a way to make this easier.', 'That’s actually pretty awesome. Thank you for sharing!! I also was not aware that Venmo asks you to verify the last four digits. That could be a solution when you’re sending money to unsaved numbers as you mentioned. Thank you!!!']"
