"We’ve reinvented the IOU

Digital-IOUs are tipped to become the next big thing in fintech.

Borrowers benefit from an increased chance of getting an IOU, lenders benefit from peace-of-mind with automated payments.

IOUcash offers no misunderstandings, no lengthy paperwork, and no loss of relationships with streamlined peer-to-peer lending, because it should be just that…mates helping mates.

Could someone, theoretically, say if you give me $100 IOU $100 + X% and decide the time frame for it? Basically creating a loan for myself?\n\nAlso, would there be something on someone’s account showing their repayment history?', 'Have you ever heard of DeFi and smart contracts? Sheesh…', '\r  \nour website link: https: //ioucash.com/']"
