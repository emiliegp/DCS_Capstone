Also its new way to think a stock trading. But the vertical will be also expand to crypto/btc data. I would describe it as the opportunity cost of one investment vs an other', ""Happy new year all. Don't want to mislead anyone here so thanks for all the repliea. It's not access to data through an api directly. It's just a better visualisation of data through a combination of vastly different charting and focus on fundamental analysis. So while it's access to the data it's not raw downloads right now"", 'Thankx alot I will pm you the details. Beta testers will get a special beta plan class applied.', 'Pm', 'This is a really cool concept to compare across types of investments. Iâ€™d love to try the beta!', 'check your PM', 'check your pm']"
