"[""We've been waiting to have women at the table for decades. Few ever show up. I work with some great women, but most simply are not interested. Just like you aren't seeing women lining up to be oil riggers, or mechanics. People are acting like it's still the 80's and all we see are women as a skirt, but it isn't like that."", 'In the name of diversity instead of merit.', 'Wow just wow.....', 'What would be the reason for not allowing press into the conference?', '>Obama urged the audience to make room for women and people of color in technology.\n\nIt\'s completely stupid to treat people differently based on superficial qualities like skin color and gender. Always.\n\n""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.""\n\nIf you\'ve got STEM skills, you\'ll be fine.\n\nNo one needs to make room, and everyone should resent the idea that black people and women need a helping hand to succeed. That\'s what I find offensive.\n\n', 'Did she say that?\n\nOr do you believe that women are naturally inferior to men?\n', 'Yes tech companies are so very welcoming to women and POCs. /s\n\nhttp://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/06/more-than-20-employees-fired-at-uber-in-sexual-harassment-investigation-report.html', ""Can't speak for OP but this myth that there is no woman in tech because it's a more hostile environment than average is nonsense.\n\nYou know why there are few qualified woman in tech? Because **few woman take CS or related STEM courses at university. That's the issue.** That's the issue that needs to be resolved if you want to see gender diversity, finding out why the hell a certain gender is *not* doing these type of studies at 3rd level education. I did computer science in 2002 with a class of 200 other people, know how many females were in our class? **8**. How many graduated? **3**.\n\nThat low level of attendance back then is why the industry is so lacking in femininity today. It is absolutely pointless pointing fingers at the CEOs of tech companies demanding they hire more women, when the women simply aren't there to be hired. There is something deeper going on in society that when people are finished high-school, for whatever reason females don't find computer science, software engineers, and related fields attractive enough to study them. They pick other fields. That's why there is a gap.\n\nFigure that out, get them into school now, and in 5-6 years you'll see much more woman in tech as the graduate. Until then, everything else is just pointless lip service."", 'I don\'t think they\'re less capable, I think they\'re less interested, and it\'s a hell of a time training for and performing at a job you don\'t care about.\n\nSTEM is about abstract thought and problem solving. Women as a subset of human beings aren\'t as interested in professions that deal with puzzles or hard manual labor or brutally long hours.\n\nIn some very specific ways, yes, women are inferior to men. Upper body strength and the ability to gain muscle mass is one. Visual reaction time is another - something like 150 milliseconds delay on average for women compared to men. Danica Patrick is famous because she\'s a female race car driver, which in itself is remarkable. But she\'s never won a race. Not one.\n\nMales have simply experienced more performance based evolutionary pressure than women have, both physically and mentally. And I say ""males"" instead of ""men"" here because that evolutionary pressure predates homo sapiens. Male primates (and mammals as a whole) have always been more likely to die from accidents, combat, or poor judgement.\n\nInvading primate groups kill males, the young, and females that fight back. The remaining, docile, timid females? That\'s who they mate with, or applying human morality, rape. That has an effect on behavioral genetics that goes back millions of years.\n\nI believe we should all be treated equally socially and in the eyes of the law, but that doesn\'t mean we are all equally capable. One look around a walmart will dispel that nonsense notion. We all have different levels of ability and to suggest that a genetic difference on the level of different chromosomes that produce radically different physiological forms is not a factor isn\'t just intellectually dishonest, it\'s willfully ignorant.\n\nThere have been studies on baby chimps in which males and females are given free reign to play with an array of toys - ranging from dolls to toy trucks.\n\nThe female chimps go for the dolls and emulate maternal behaviors. The males, despite not knowing what a truck is, gravitate towards the toy trucks, the things with moving parts.\n\nHumans like to think we\'re this super evolved fluke, but we aren\'t. Our taxonomy is best described as ""talking ape"".', ""I'd guess it depends on location. The US has a much bigger diversity issue than here in Europe, and we're not perfect either, but it really pisses me off when Europeans start quoting US figures and try to say the apply to Europe when they really don't. I did a lot of work in the Telco sector and yes it was heavily weighted with Men, but so few women went into electronic engineering in college, while recently I've been working in a combination of FinTech and Public sector projects where its evenly distributed between men and women. TBH there's even a rise in the number of women at the top in FinTech because after the crash a lot of more senior men jumped ship and left the industry allowing for more women to take the helm.
