Cybersecurity Solution for an RIA Firm
2022-07-08 04:43:29
"Hi All,

I work for a financial advisor and have been tasked with looking into our cybersecurity. I do not have an IT background, but am somewhat computer savy. We have 10 employees so we are not very large.

Currently we contract with a local shop when we need IT help, which isn't very often. However, our current firewall is outdated (Dell Sonicwall APL31-0B9), and our current antivirus solution is embarrassing (not a business solution). 

I am aiming for compliance with the SEC's cyber checklist, and currently we need a lot of work for that. [https://www.sec.gov/files/OCIE%20Cybersecurity%20and%20Resiliency%20Observations.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/files/OCIE%20Cybersecurity%20and%20Resiliency%20Observations.pdf)

I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations on what we should get. Should we purchase a new firewall, plus a business antivirus license? Sophos MTR? Or would you steer towards something like Itegria's Virtual desktop solution ($300\~ user a month)

I am thinking it may be more practical to potentially hire an IT specialist to help with this, or outsource it to a firm who specializes in compliance.

I have realized that what we need is going to be a lot more $$$ than my boss has been paying, so I want to make a solid decision. 

Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit for this.

I would appreciate any opinions or reading material!

Thanks."
