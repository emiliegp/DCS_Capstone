"Dear All,

I am pursuing PhD in management in India and planning to take up research in Fintech with a focus on applications of AI/ML in commercial banking domain particularly the credit underwriting of business lending. I am thinking of developing model that is based on recent business information along with historical financial ratios. I am not very certain of getting the data required for the research in credit model building. So, I sometimes think of doing research in trading to built ML models as secondary data is available. I have about 8 years experience in commercial banking and have significant experience in credit underwriting using traditional models. Looking for members point of view considering concerns, relevance and future prospects. Thank you!"
