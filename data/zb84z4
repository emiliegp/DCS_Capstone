Intraday Options Backtesting Website
2022-12-03 15:59:59
"Hello everyone ,

As a hobby project , I’ve designed a website which allows you to test out option strategies based on your favourite indicators.

What this means is that you can now trade nifty/ bank nifty options by using entry and exit conditions generated by applying super trend , moving averages etc on the corresponding spot chart.

Do let me know what you think of it. Any ideas and suggestions are welcome !

Look and feel of the website:

General Questions:

***What does it do ?***

* *allow you to backtest option strategies by applying indicators on the underlying.*

***Is it free ?***

* *yes it’s completely free. Just input your parameters and get started.*

***How does it work ?***

* *entry and exit signals are generated based on the indicator applied.*
* *Entry happens only when there is signal change. Exit happens when there is a signal change or stop loss/ trailing stop loss is hit.*

***How can it help you ?***

* *will save you time and effort.*
* *You can build on the results further to develop your own trading systems.*
* *Test out your strategies before deploying real money in the live market.*

***How is it different from other backtesting websites in this domain?***

* *allows you to test directional optional selling - both buying and selling- by generating conditions from applying indicators on the underlying.*

***Why did I build it ?***

* *using this tool will result in lesser time to backtest - no need to go through the hassle of finding options data and manually inputting entry and exit prices.*
* *Allows you to backtest your favourite indicators which you have found or some trainer might have told you works*

***How much time does it take to run the backtest ? Is it free ?***

* *depends on the date range.*

***How many months of data can we backrest with ?***

* *since running backtest is computationally expensive , the current implementation supports only 6 months of backtesting.*

***From where did I get the data ?***

* *I’ve paid for the data for the first 3 months*
* *Since the prices were too high , I then wrote a script which would capture all prices from my brokers terminal for the last 6 months.*

***Which all indicators are supported ?***

* *currently only supertrend. Many more indicators to come !*

***How to interpret the results ?***

* *most people jump straight to the profit. I’d suggest to look at the max drawdown first , then risk reward and then finally the total profit*

***Can these be inputted into an algorithm and trade on my behalf ?***

* *yes. As a matter of fact I’m already doing so and I can vouch for the fact that it works. Algo trading is the future !*"
"['One more question for the FAQ:\n\n*Can we upload our ideas to you to ""test out"" so you can compare them and trade the ones you like?*\n\n-\t*certainly, that\'s what it is for and that\'s why it\'s free, so you will!*\n\n;-)']"
