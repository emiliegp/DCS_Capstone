"Payroll Data Aggregators 2020 (Argyle, Atomic, Citadel, Pinwheel, Plaid Income, Verix)"
2022-03-02 02:35:54
"Similar post to what I did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/hqin2y/fintech_data_aggregators_2020_plaid_yodlee/) a few years ago. This post will focus on ""consumer authenticated"" payroll data API companies (and not B2B players like Finch or Payroll-as-a-Service players like Check).

Exploring [Alex's article](https://newsletter.fintechtakes.com/p/payroll-fintech) sparked my interest to know more about the overall history and landscape of this vertical. I've taken some notes below. Curious for more thoughts/input from people who know more. I took a pass at detailing the front end of the developer experience by running through their docs, but would be interested about data quality and backend tech (is one doing more APIs and another more screenscraping?)

# Argyle - [Link](https://argyle.com/)

General:

* Founded in 2018
* Pros:
   * Three different payroll products:
      * Income & Employment Verification (general payroll data)
      * Deposit Switching (allows external apps to update direct deposit)
      * Paycheck-linked lending (repay your loans from your paycheck)
   * Broad coverage on paper (with a cool coverage [page](https://argyle.com/coverage))
      * 170M+ US employees
      * 75% of the US workforce
      * 500k Employers
      * 60% of the Fortune 500
      * 300+Payroll and gig platforms
   * Clear marketing (""Here are our products. Here are the industries/types of people we serve"")
   * Support for API, portal, and PDF outputs. That's smart.
   * Extra data elements for gig workers. Neat.
* Cons: Documented some [here](https://twitter.com/healthbjk/status/1497639087028654083?s=20&t=zctNrhz7XfbibyyAkcIa9A).
   * Weird use of a fake ""standards"" site, when it's not an actual standards body.
   * Also some privacy concerns paying gig workers for their credentials
   * Not fully transparent pricing.
   * My last three employers are not findable via their [Coverage page](https://argyle.com/coverage)

Technical (Developer Experience)

* I really dig the clean and differentiated look of their docs.
* Nice layout. It starts by cleanly routing you by use case (with specific product features below that).
* Basic Auth. Meh, but that's seemingly okay in fintech.
* Tons of developer tools. Really impressive.

Pricing

* [Not fully transparent](https://argyle.com/pricing). Need to have a conversation to actually get a quote.

# Atomic - [Link](https://atomic.financial/)

General:

* Founded in  August of 2019
* Pros:
   * Four different payroll products:
      * Deposit (allows external apps to update direct deposit)
      * Verify (general payroll data - income and employment status)
      * Identify (make sure someone is who they say they are during onboarding)
      * Withhold (not released yet but year round tax refunding / withholding of some kind)
   * Clear marketing (""Here are our products. Here are the industries/types of people we serve"")
* Cons:
   * [Gated, non-transparent coverage](https://info.atomic.financial/) (I had to sign up, but it prompted me for a password I didn't receive)
   * [Non-transparent pricing](https://atomic.financial/faqs/how-much-do-atomics-payroll-api-products-cost/)
   * No apparent developer tools (compared to Argyle)

Technical (Developer Experience)

https://preview.redd.it/q1ct27fuwkk81.png?width=2818&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e2f84f79a3906471fef3e99d60e786cac73385e

* All these developer docs are so beautiful. I really want to know the backends/tooling they're using to generate.
* Nice layout. It starts by cleanly routing you by use case (with specific product features below that).
* Token-based auth, so slightly more secure than Basic.

Pricing

* Not transparent

# Citadel - [Link](https://www.citadelid.com/)

General:

* Founded in 2020
* Pros:
   * Products:
      * Income and employment (general payroll data - income and employment status)
      * Employment history  (general payroll data - historic income and employment status)
      * Direct deposit switch (allows external apps to update direct deposit)
      * Employee directory (not consumer auth)
      * Payroll history (not consumer auth)
   * Interestingly plays in both consumer auth space, but also the B2B ""Admin"" space.
      * Wonder if that's appealing and effective, as it feels like it's different personas/not a good Venn diagram of upsell (lenders and financial institutions for consumer, HR admins at employers for the admin) so it just increases their competitive surface
   * Free tier in their pricing!
   * [Coverage page](https://www.citadelid.com/coverage)
      * 120M working Americans
      * 86.4% coverage of Fortune 1,000 companies
      * Top 48 largest payroll providers
      * All major gig economy companies
* Cons:
   * Website is fine, but Argyle and Atomic appear to have invested a bit more to be flashy there
   * Marketing missing the ""industries"" or ""who we serve"" aspect.
      * This is important to help developers and other potential customers self-identify as a potential client and provides another way to map API functionality mentally.
   * Non-transparent pricing
   * Gated, non-transparent coverage
   * No apparent developer tools (compared to Argyle)

Technical (Developer Experience)

* Developer pages are fine (just standard branded Readme)
* No developer tools
* Client ID and access key in headers for auth (yuck)

Pricing

* What is it with this industry and non-transparent API pricing?
* At least they have a stated free tier

# Pinwheel - [Link](https://www.pinwheelapi.com/)

General:

* Founded in 2018
* Pros:
   * Products:
      * Direct deposit switching (allows external apps to update direct deposit)
      * Recurring Access: Direct Deposits (this feels like remarketing a subfeature)
      * Income and employment data (general payroll data - income and employment status)
      * Paycheck linked lending (repay your loans from your paycheck)
   * &#x200B;
* Cons:
   * Marketing missing the ""industries"" or ""who we serve"" aspect
      * This is important to help developers and other potential customers self-identify as a potential client and provides another way to map API functionality mentally.
   * Non-transparent coverage
      * I don't even see a page to ask for a full list
   * Non-transparent pricing
      * No landing page at all for pricing. Need to add that, even if it's non-transparent like the others on this list.
   * No apparent developer tools (compared to Argyle)

Technical (Developer Experience)

https://preview.redd.it/mh1dlesv4lk81.png?width=2844&format=png&auto=webp&s=d2a76634e9c694eccf3bcd30f8a76153265bdc1d

* Developer pages are fine (just standard branded Readme)
* No developer tools
* Auth is API secret in header. Jesus, these companies are absolute sickos when it comes to auth

Pricing

* No landing page at all for pricing. Need to add that, even if it's non-transparent like the others on this list.

# Plaid Income

General:

* Launched in 2021
* Pros:
   * One-stop shop - The types of customers Plaid already has are the types of customers that also might want Plaid Income. Anti-multihoming is smart.
   * Stated coverage:
      * 250,000 employers
      * 40+ payroll providers and gig platforms
      * 70% of US workers
   * &#x200B;
* Cons:
   * Closed, private beta right now
   * Non-transparent coverage
   * Non-transparent pricing

Technical (Developer Experience)

* Beautiful API reference (like all Plaid docs) but content is limited
* Client ID and secret in header. I guess I should stop complaining
* Mixed in with a lot of other APIs
* Developer tooling is solid
   * OpenAPI
   * Postman
   * Client libraries

Pricing

* Pricing unclear (maybe bundled in with [this](https://plaid.com/pricing/)?)

# Verix / Wage

General:

* Founded in 2018
* RIP. They appear to have closed shop after [raising in 2021 amid a pivot to ""credentialess payroll access""](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wage-secures-5m-to-scale-credential-less-payroll-data-api-301267674.html)

# Summary

It's really hard to assess these companies given the lack of transparency in coverage and pricing, given those are super important factors in the effectiveness of an API aggregator.

That said, if I had to pick, I'm torn between Argyle (transparent coverage, great developer tooling, but kinda shady), Atomic (mature offering that's not shady), and Plaid (reduces vendor bloat if I'm using their traditional product, good developer tooling, but beta).

Curious for thoughts or additional info (coverage or pricing or experiences)!"
