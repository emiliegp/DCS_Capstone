"Hello,

I recently joined one of the organisations that deals with digital payments as a software developer. Basically the organisation is an acquirer. I'm having a difficult time getting resources to read about how the different systems work or how the payments are handled. If you know of any resource that might help me understand I'll be very grateful. Or if you could point me to the right direction."
"['Check out two books by Carol Coye Benson - global Payments and Payment Systems in the US (even if you arenâ€™t from the US). These books have a good balance of theory and specifics.', 'This article does a decent job at walking through the value chain, including each of the players, what they do and who they interact with. https://switchpayments.com/learn/609ceb4366cfb30013d58cdb', ""Thank you. I'll check them out."", 'Thank you. This has helped a lot.']"
