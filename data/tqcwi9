"Hello. I (23M) am a university student studying statistics and finance. This year I started getting into data science and am thinking about pursuing a career in fintech/DS.

How relevant is DS in finance already? Is it something that is still developing or do most firms heavily use ML, AI, etc. in their practices?"
"['Everyone is talking about it, many companies are using it, a few companies are using it well.\n\nThe potential is huge, fintech businesses are mostly built on being able to offer services to a huge quantity of customers with very low margins compared to traditional players. Machine learning is a strategic fit because it leverages the large user base to build/train models which automate processes / decisions and further reduce the cost base.', ""Finance =/= fintech. It is very important for fintech but not as much for finance. If you want to be a quant it is good to know but I wouldn't recommend being a quant, if you have those skills be a ML engineer at a fintech company."", 'Yes, we need data scientists in our industry - for our firm we can’t really get enough.', 'It is in high demand. But make sure you build models that are relevant to finance and FinTech. \n\nHere’s a list of FinTechs that use AI for sure, I’m certain there are even more today:\n\nhttps://www.awesomefintech.com/category/ai-in-fintech/']"
