"Hello everyone,

I'm a Canadian student that's about to graduate in Toronto. I had some internship experiences in both finance and in software development and I'm thinking I want to try out some fintech as my career after graduation. Due to personal interests, I naturally know some things here and there about investing and economics, and I want to learn more about crypto and NFTs. I want to know what opportunities there are for someone like me to network around."
"['Toronto has a good FinTech hub and few startup accelerators. \n\nWhatâ€™s your background, besides passion for crypto and NFTs?']"
