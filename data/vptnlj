Nearshore software development for FinTech
2022-07-03 01:01:20
"My business partner and I are considering specializing our offshore software development consulting agency in US FinTech. Our business is a US LLC, but we (and our entire technical technical team) are in Mexico.

We are looking into either focusing exclusively on FinTech. Does anyone know of any customer privacy data regulations or anything other regulations that require software developers to be physically located in the US? Trying to determine what could be deterrents for specific FinTech focus.

Thanks in advance for any feedback!"
"['You don’t need to be physically collocated. Nobody is today because of remote work. \n\nBut you won’t get core projects, most likely you will get side projects until there is more confidence. \n\nOnce you get connects their compliance and bank partners will do lengthy due diligence with you and you will need to adopt specific policies around code control, employee monitoring etc. as well as carry additional insurance. \n\nYou want your employees to get training on PII, PCI and do everything possible to not touch the customer data. \n\nAll that said this is probably not the best time to focus exclusively on FinTech because the companies in this industry have hemorrhaged valuation and have gone through serious layoffs. \n\nYou might consider healthcare industry since it is still booming and has a similar compliance burden.', 'Pretty much what he said…', ""Thanks! We actually are weighing the pros and cons of FinTech vs HealthTech. We were considering EdTech too (a personal interest of mine), but we have some doubts about the long-term consistent funding. It spiked during COVID, but in general it seems to receive about 10% of the funding that HealthTech does in the US.\n\nI actually posted in the HealthTech subreddit too asking about geographic requirements and regs to look into other than HIPAA. We are inclined to go with HealthTech if we don't find anything prohibitive due to the team working outside the US.""]"
