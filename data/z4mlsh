"[""Whether its a discount rate or an interest rate makes no difference, its dishonest to pretend they are different things. It doesn't build a lot of confidence in your business if you can't just be straightforward about it. \n\nSecondly, the point of the business is that the counterparty risk is from the issuing bank, not the merchant, and that's why the product works. Not that hard to explain, so why not explain it?"", 'I own a title loan company and I think we are an MCA cousin. No reason to pretend things arenâ€™t what they are. The world needs shylocks', ""That's a wrong perspective. Discounted rate means (in this context) buying a portion of business upcoming assets at a lower value (as the actual valuation could be higher) and MCA don't charge any interest but rather a lum-sum amount is drawn out of whatever the sales figure is.""]"
