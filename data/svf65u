What business licenses do these FinTech companies have?

"I'm thinking about starting a Revenue-Based Financing company and can't find any information on what type of business license these FinTech companies have! Do they just have a normal banking license? I'm talking about these companies here -> [Silvr](https://en.silvr.co/), [Re;Cap](https://www.re-cap.com/), and [Pipe](https://pipe.com/).

I'm looking to start it in Europe, so any help would be much appreciated :) 

Thank you!"
"[""The answer is... it depends. But usually fintechs doing lending or deposits (if they aren't a licensed and regulated FI already) are 'renting' a bank license through a deal with a sponsor bank like cross-river, metabank, sutton bank, BBVA, Goldman etc."", ""Not sure what you mean by banking licenses, but it really depends on how they move the funds. The below is from a U.S. perspective. I haven't studied them specifically but I have a good idea of lending / money movement laws (fintech credit card experience).   \n\n\nFor example. If you sign up on Pipe and get an advance on your subscription revenue there are a few ways this could work.   \n\n\n1. Pipe sends you the money from their account and then collects the money each month from you into their account.\n   1. If the fine print of the loan agreement is between you and Pipe, then this is fine and there are no licenses required except for state lending licenses (in the U.S.).\n   2. If the fine print of the loan agreement is between you and a BANK, things change\n      1. If pipe is acting only as a servicer / mover of funds between you and the bank, they would need a money transmission license. This is incredibly expensive. \n      2. If pipe buys your debt from the bank after the agreement is signed, then they do not need a MTL and simply are acting as a collector of their newly purchased receivables. They wouldn't need any license outside of certain state licenses. **This is the likely scenario.**\n2. A bank sends you the money and your monthly subscriptions go to a bank\n   1. Pipe only takes an origination fee from the lender. No licenses required unless certain states want to be assholes for servicing a loan."", 'Super informative, thanks for this', 'so for a micro lending app that lends out under $100 i would not need a license if it sjust between me and the customers bank and i keep it under a certain APR? I was looking into making a micro lending app $10-$100max pay day loans', 'From what you said I think you still need a license in the borrowers state. I canâ€™t say for certain without more info']"
