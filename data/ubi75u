Fintech is confusing for me
2022-04-25 20:44:04
"Hello guys, I just joined this sub because recent years have brought substantial improvements in the fintech space along with huge investments and I want to break into that space but right now I donâ€™t know a thing about fintech other than the fact that it allows people to transfer money overseas. 
What principles underlie Fintech?
How does the electronically transfered money get to the other country in cash?
What would I need to implement my own fintech company?

I appreciate your help in advance. Thanks"
