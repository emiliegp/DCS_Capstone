"['""fintech"" is just standard finance, as seen here a ""fintech"" company is acquiring a bank to just become a normal financial services company. At some point people should just admit that all this ""financial technology innovation"" is just more predatory credit services.', 'Fin tech is just a bubbly web interface to the archaic bank cobol mainframes.', 'Pretty much.  I had a need for SoFi a few years back - a short term loan that I used as a bridge, then paid off in 4 months instead of four years.\n\nFor what they were, they were easy and fast.  Now that they’re becoming a banking institution, they’ll lose that... and customers along with it.  Nobody is loyal to banks anymore... nor should they be.  Banks offer the worst products and rates vs what people want.']"
