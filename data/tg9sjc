The FinTech landscape is changing at lightning speed. These transformations affect everything related to payments, money, and banking.

ðŸ”¸ The rise of integrated finance:

Integrated finance has taken the financial world by storm, and its growth will likely continue throughout 2022. Integrated investment programs make the field more accessible by offering easy and affordable funds and stocks. Users increasingly prefer these platforms.

ðŸ”¸ Better forex solutions for SMEs:

We all know that covid led to a massive increase in home deliveries, and with it came a corresponding expansion of international e-commerce. That, in turn, offered significant growth potential for SMEs worldwide. Fortunately, new solutions are emerging, such as BaaS platforms that provide services in foreign currencies. It seems that in 2022, there will be an increase in using them with the arrival of new players in the market.

ðŸ”¸ Traditional financial institutions exploring crypto and NFTs:

While many financial analysts focus on how blockchain technology may disrupt banking, it is worth bearing in mind that several banks are jumping on the blockchain bandwagon, mainly due to the extreme returns compared to traditional channels. The technology can speed up asset transfers, payments, and even investments, eliminating errors that cause delays and costs.

Could you add any other?"
