Banks active in providing credit lines to fintechs for SME lending
2022-12-03 04:42:17
"I am trying to circle a niche of banks in Europe that are active in providing credit lines to fintechs who lend to SMEs. It can be either via fronting or off-balance sheet SPV warehouse facility. The names I know off are:

Silicon Valley Bank, SolarisBank, BNP Paribas, Varengold

Does anyone know any other names? I am interested primarily in banks, not credit funds. Will appreciate any informed input."
"['If you don’t know any and haven’t started then you need to work with a credit fund. Banks won’t do the first facility', 'Fat chance these days.  Banks are trying to protect their businesses now, that’s why companies like wise having difficulties with other countries banks…', 'They are expensive. Their pricing kills unit economics.', 'Are you saying Wise is trying to enter other countries and local banks are hesitant to partner with them?\n\nThat being said, they are already all over EU. I am really just expecting them to apply for full banking license soon.', 'haha, welcome to starting a debt business. Use them for a year and then trade for a bank when you can. Unless you have a major equity backing or experience in credit its your only option.', 'That’s correct for Wise.  Check out what’s happened in Dubai and in Australia. Eventually they’ll get it but not without resistance.  The regulators want open market.\nI had a whale of a time trying to get bank accounts for my biz.']"
