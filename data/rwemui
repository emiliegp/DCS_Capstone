Does PayPal use Visa/Mastercard's network?

"I know Visa/Mastercard facilitates transactions by connecting the consumer and merchant as well as their issuing and acquiring bank. I'm wondering if PayPal uses these rails when payments are made in their system? Or are they able to bypass them and handle the transaction themselves?

I'm not talking about the processing of the payment (clearing and settlement of funds), but rather the communication between the issuing and acquiring bank. For example, in a sale made online through PayPal, can PayPal be the network for these two banks or would they still use Visa/Mastercard rails?"
"[""It depends how the customer is paying.\n\nPay with card via a PayPal checkout: yes, standard card payment flow via visa /mc\n\nPay with an existing PayPal balance; no, this is an 'on us' transaction that doesn't use the cards payments rails. \n\nPay with PayPal using a bank account instead of, card to fund: no, uses bank payment rails not card."", 'Discover and Amex are closed loop meaning they authorize, issue and interact with merchants all in one go. \n\nVisa / Mastercard do not issue and rely on banks.\n\nPayPal will only facilitate your transaction if you have a balance in your PayPal account. Otherwise a CC, Debit account would be the main rails', '>Pay with card via a PayPal checkout: yes, standard card payment flow via visa /mc\n\nTo confirm, this is referring to a physical PoS transaction right?', 'It\'s a good start. There\'s more here.\n\nPayPal doesn\'t own ""rails"" in the sense of a card network (e.g. Visa, Amex) or interbank payments (e.g. ACH, wire). They either settle transactions internally or facilitate money movement on other companies\' rails.\n\nA bit of history will help. Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, eBay struggled massively with payments fraud. Traditional money services businesses like Western Union left the buyer  naked to delivery risk - they pay, goods never arrive. Similar problems with the card networks. The problem with both is that the payment *leaves the network* (via banks) before goods arrive.\n\nPayPal offered an alternative. PayPal will own and maintain the ledger that keeps track of who-owns-what. When you ""transfer"" money from one PayPal account to another, it never leaves PayPal\'s ledger. That gives PayPal two massive advantages: (1) control over the money movement, (2) lots of data on the sender and receiver. Combined, PayPal was able to reduce payment fraud to just a fraction of what is experienced via traditional money services businesses and card networks.\n\nWhen money needs to leave PayPal\'s ledger, such as when you cash-out to a bank, we\'re back into the normal of third party rails.\n\nThe biggest problem with this model is that regulations haven\'t kept up. Money services businesses regulations were designed for entities that move money, not ones that offer services very similar to demand deposit accounts (e.g. checking account).\n\nWhereas bank demand deposit accounts have lots of protections including FDIC insurance and privileges during bank bankruptcy, PayPal\'s accounts have none. PayPal is also a lot riskier from an account holder\'s perspective. Banks have significant capital requirements, PayPal doesn\'t. In fact, despite PayPal\'s 10\'s of billions of customer dollars in accounts, they can meet *all* of their capital obligations in *all 50 states* with just $3 million in retained earnings and equity! Not much of a buffer against *billions* in customer dollars.\n\nI give you the full color because this is likely to go through meaningful change in the next few years. The rise of cash-backed stablecoins (e.g. USDC, USDP) from non-bank entities is creating yet another payment rail and yet another type of almost-demand-deposit instrument outside of the bank regulatory perimeter.\n\nAs PayPal and others continue to grow, and as stablecoins continue to grow, the regulatory perimeter will be modified to strengthen the system. That\'ll have significant implications for who gets to issue the new assets and how the new rails work.', 'No this is referring to any payment using a Visa or a Mastercard payment credential.']"
