"Hi fellows,

What tools do you use to monitor and manage compliance (AML/BSA/transactions)? What can you recommend and why?

Thanks!"
"['Metamap for KYC/AML, middesk for KYB, anvil for docs/audit trail', 'IDology + Complyadvantage', 'Use Sphonic â€¦. They are an aggregator.  PM me', 'Alessa is a great alternative to complyadvantage.', 'Full disclosure - Im working with Persona\n\nPersona :)', '>Metamap for KYC/AML, middesk for KYB, anvil for docs/audit trail\n\nCool! Did you build your docs/audit trail app in-house? What led you to do that?  \nAny particular reason why you have chosen Metamap & Middesk?', 'Thanks for sharing your insights!\nHow did you decide on this combination? What led you go for comply advantage?', 'Thanks for sharing! What do you like about it in particular?', 'Yeah the audit trail was built in house but Anvil is our signing software and they have an API to pass custom fields through.  Middesk is the best KYB hands down, and metamask lets us send images to the API instead of just using a non custom SDK (which is fairly rare for KYC)', 'It was by far the cheapest. Complyadvantage  was recommended to us by a friend that has done a lot in the space. IDology is tough to work with, but is significantly cheaper than others out there.   \n\n\nI would recommend this combo if you really need to save on cost. If you care more about speed, UI, and functionality I would look at Socure, Onfido, or Alloy', 'Once you are set up, everything is so simple to use. (I will admit that set up is extensive and is fine tuned for each industry/organization.) \n\nThe software is awesome at detecting high risk entities and activities early by creating alerts to be reviewed based on the parameters set. \n\nThey are also investing heavily into more machine learning and AI to further their automation processes', '>Yeah the audit trail was built in house but Anvil is our signing software and they have an API to pass custom fields through.

Thank you!', 'Thanks! I will ping you a DM if you are up for a chat?']"
