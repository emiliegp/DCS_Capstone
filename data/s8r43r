"Where things started, where we are at and where we are headed towards? A resource that's relatively easy to grasp and is interesting."
"[""This is tough to answer because FinTech and Banking encompass so many different subjects! Investopedia is a great place to start, try this one: [https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/banking.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/banking.asp)\n\nI would definitely either look at things chronologically or by specific verticals (e.g. payments, loans, investing) to compartmentalize your learning. If you're looking to go an inch deep and a mile wide, consulting companies generally publish broad market scanning reports periodically: [https://fintechworldreport.com/](https://fintechworldreport.com/)."", 'I’ve been trying to answer a similar question holistically for FinTech as well. \n\nSo far I’ve got this list compiled that gives you an overview of banking in general:\nhttps://www.awesomefintech.com/topic/banking/', 'I would start by checking out the occ handbook and news bulletin about Sofi getting chartered\nhttps://www.occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2022/nr-occ-2022-4.html', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlUtFokWKwA', 'There\'s so many resources out there, my personal favourite is this one which I found recently:\n\n[https://www.stephenson.law/fintech-trends-for-2022/?utm\\_source=Reddit](https://www.stephenson.law/fintech-trends-for-2022/?utm_source=Reddit)  \n\n\nThey cover all the big trends that are predicted to happen in 2022 and also have a really handy ""jargon buster"" which explains some of the terms if you are new and don\'t know them.', 'Thank you so much for taking the time to drop the resources!']"
