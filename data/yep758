"Hi everyone,  
I was of the Onboarding & KYC product manager and UX/UI designer at Rewire (a digital bank for migrants, acquired by Remitly).

For several years I got to work on improving our KYC flow to achieve better conversion rate and experience while keeping our service safe.

A while ago I wrote a blog post on a few of the UX methods we applied to the flow and what was the impact.

Would love to hear your thoughts on what we did and on the blog post.

Here it is: [https://vaulted-law-a70.notion.site/Creating-the-perfect-KYC-61c5ac3e7cfe422dae5f53d65d710f82](https://vaulted-law-a70.notion.site/Creating-the-perfect-KYC-61c5ac3e7cfe422dae5f53d65d710f82)

Hope you'll like it, Thanks!"
"['This was great! Smart idea to have the user continue the flow while the async checks are run.', ""Wow, quite interesting to read about optimizing KYC from a design perspective. I'm a developer, so for me, it's more about automating data extraction [with OCR](https://mobidev.biz/blog/ocr-technology-optical-character-recognition-machine-learning), chatbots and biometrics. Now I see that if you add the best UX/UI practices to the implementation of technologies, you can get outstanding results. Cool!"", 'Thanks for the great article!', ""Oh, thanks man, that't cool.\n\nThis is actually the basis to what I'm doing today at Ballerine.\n\nSee here: [https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine](https://github.com/ballerine-io/ballerine)"", 'Thank you for sharing']"
