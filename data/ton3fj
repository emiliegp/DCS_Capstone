Can I get a job in fintech without a bachelors degree? I think this would help a lot of people.

"I’m really interested in fintech and would like to take a 6 week course at The University of Hong Kong. The course claims that those who complete the course are qualified as a ‘Certified Fintech Professional’ under the Global Academy of Finance and Management (GAFM). Would I be able to use this certification alone, and without a college degree to get a job? I keep running into walls trying to find an answer if college is needed or not to work in fintech. Hopefully someone working in, or knowledgeable of the space can give insight. I feel that others may also have this question so hopefully this goes somewhere.
