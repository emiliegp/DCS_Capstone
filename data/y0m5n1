"Looking for recommendations of a good PR contractor or agency.

Need someone with experience in the lending fintech startup space (bonus points for experience in the related VC or ML space and/or in both US & Latin America). 

We're a small shop that partners with lending fintechs and are looking to increase visibility of our existing work to that community.

Thanks for any Public Relations recommendations!"
