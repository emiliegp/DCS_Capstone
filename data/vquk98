I want to create a banking app that creates Universal Basic Income for all of it's users via redistribution of a consumption tax between users

Any advice?
"['I like the idea of UBI funded by a consumption tax, but I have no idea how you would do this without being the government. Anyone who would pay more than they receive would just not use the app.', 'How can I buy puts on this', 'Sorry, but your idea sucks. Let me know when this is created so I can spend $0 a day and get free money daily.', 'How does that work?', ""I don't believe in UBI, it seems opposite to decentralization."", 'The only feasible way I can see is by starting your own card brand, not very much unlike [Discover](https://www.discover.com/) (so you don\'t have to pay the Visa/Mastercard ‚Äútax‚Äù), and financing your UBI via the merchant fees and may be a higher APR in the case of credit cards, not a ‚Äúconsumption tax.""  \n\n\nBut even then with so much competition I expect you will have a hard time finding paying costumers (merchant fees will be used to finance the UBI, so no points/cashback will be offered, and the many banks and credit unions offering lower APRs on credit cards.)

With an x% tax per transaction I would never want to spend money. Although, that doesn‚Äôt make it a bad idea. I‚Äôd set up an account like that to help someone or myself who has a spending problem. \n\nThe UBI part doesn‚Äôt make much sense. It‚Äôs just moving money in a circle. It goes from me to you and then back to me, it could just stay with me and earn interest. I get it‚Äôs nice if you need $20 to cover a cost, but you could just use Chime‚Äôs SpotMe feature. \n\nMy final thought is how do you make money from this. I understand you‚Äôre going the nonprofit route, but you still need to cover operation costs. Other banks make their money every time a card is swiped, this platform encourages you to not spend. You‚Äôd have to have some fees involved which is the opposite direction that every other banking services app is going. \n\nIt‚Äôs an outside the box idea, don‚Äôt stop brainstorming on this. Please also post an update about how you reincorporated the feedback you received here because I think everyone here would be interested to see where such an idea goes. Good luck!', 'This üëÜ.

I'm building this system not for profit but to encourage growth in the economy through the idea that if you're spending money you have some to spare.

Good luck.', 'I‚Äôm not sure I understand why someone would be willing to sign up for an app that penalizes them when they spend money with a consumer tax. \n\nWhat if the money was spent to fix a broken car or perform an essential surgery. \n\nThe upcharge might incentivize someone to delay expenses that would worsen health risk.', ""If you're considering crypto then this would be dead in the water immediately as a mass market product, it would also need to be a coin you mint to be able to impose the fees which has a whole truckload of other work involved.\n\nThen you also open up an entire other barrel of worms with crypto price fluctuations being more impactful to your users than the system ever will.\n\nThen this still doesn't even solve the situation of people setting up wallets to simply get payouts, or doing the bare minimum possible to get payouts and make a profit.\n\nSorry I like your enthusiasm but the only way I see this working is either if you're the government, or maybe if you were to theme it as a target for a specific at risk group. This way you can control who benefits from it and minimise the payouts to scammers (although they will always be present).\n\nDoing it for an at risk group could work, although as another user here suggested you'd need to get rid of the 10% consumption rate, that's far too high. Ideally you'd setup as a card network eg VISA and you could charge a small percentage to your users and a small percentage to networks that accept you. That spreads the cost to help adoption.\n\nAlthough that would be a lot of work, a quick way of doing it would be using a card issuer like Stripe, but you can only charge your users (not merchants) and I'm sure it also has subscription costs for each card that's active.
