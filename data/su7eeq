"We’re looking for an all in one BaaS API that supports lending, p2p payments, physical and digital wallet accounts. Stripe API looks good but is only B2B."
"['Check out Productfy, Synapse, etc. depends on what your use case is?', 'Make sure to check out Synctera as well', 'What country?', 'excuse my ignorance but what’s baas? banking as a service? backend as a service?', ""Qolo is the best I've seen.   \n\n\nSynpase is dogshit."", 'Thank you, Synapse looks very promising. Congrats on your first comment too:)', 'Banking as a service. Typically using another banks infrastructure to create a smaller neo bank.']"
