Does anyone know of a neobank that allows to have multiple logins? Like one readonly and one with Permission to send money.
"['I know Gemini does, but itâ€™s crypto based. I have tried most neobanks but no notable ones have this.', ""Mercury if you're looking for the business use case.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsumer I can't think of any unless you used a layer like Plaid maybe?""]"
