"Hi Everyone,

On my most recent podcast episode, I chatted with Michael Chrisment, the Ex-CEO of FinTech startup Farmer Connect. Farmer Connect is a company that sells a product to cocoa and coffee producers to track their supply chain utilising IBM's hyperledger blockchain. I think some of you would enjoy listening to Michael talk about his career and journey (he is also just a cool guy in general imo).

Here's the link to the episode: [https://youtu.be/uPMZrpRtS5U](https://youtu.be/uPMZrpRtS5U)"
