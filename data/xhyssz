Looking to get into fintech.

Would I have a chance getting a job as some sort of software developer or algorithmic trading developer with a bachelors in economics and a software development certification? Or should I just major in comp sci?
"['For any software developer career (Fintech or not) definitely major in comp science. Then choose minors on top to reflect your interests, eg data / economics / math / statistics.', ""The economics degree wouldn't count for much. But there are software devs out there that didn't go to college and are self taught. You just gotta be able to point to a lot of experience and self-taught know how. Have an impressive git profile. Work experience trumps education of course."", 'Go data science, go hard. \n\nOr go Saas sales', 'That makes sense, I’m a comp sci major currently just was conflicted a little.', 'I don’t think a minor is necessary, but if you can fit it, it may be beneficial in math or stats. Overall a comp sci degree is valuable whereas economics + a paperweight certification is not.']"
