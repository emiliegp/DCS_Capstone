"['Unreal. In my 8th year running my B2B Fintech SaaS company. Bootstrapped our way to a $12.5M valuation. Have a Shark Tank Shark on the board with other experienced investors. I donâ€™t know any VCs or PE firms, and neither does my board, but itâ€™s kind of a moot point at $12.5M. Technically weâ€™re still at the seed stage, too small for the big guys. \n\nHow do these companies achieve these levels of funding? Seems like itâ€™s entirely about who you know.', ""I'm new to this space. What are the names of these companies? Thanks."", 'Been following fintech on and off since 2016, just shows how much the industry has come on.', 'Bootstrapped valuation are usually much more real than valuations of the VC-backed startups. \n\nYouâ€™re right about network and investors you know, but also whom your investors know too.', 'Thatâ€™s awesome. And when you sell one day, youâ€™ll actually get to keep most of that money.', 'Iâ€™ll do a separate post about each company a bit later today. \n\nIn the meantime you can find names of the companies here: https://www.awesomefintech.com/blog/\n\nJust look for the posts dated last week.']"
