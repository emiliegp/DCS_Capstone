2022-02-13 23:53:41
"Hello - I  work for an early stage fintech start up, Sugar Wallet. We are looking to launch a personal finance app in the UK.

This 5 minute [survey](https://research.typeform.com/to/PyOz5ii8) seeks to understand your budgeting, saving and investing behaviour. It can be done completely anonymously. But if you provide your email, Sugar Wallet can offer 2-weeks free use of the product once it launches in the UK.

Do ignore if you can't be bothered. Thanks in advance for your help."
