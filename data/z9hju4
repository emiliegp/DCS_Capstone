Legal requirements to start a payment gateway in the US
2022-12-01 18:21:26
"We have a payment gateway that we have been piloting outside US. It is a payment gateway like Stripe but for a specific niche i.e highly customized for a specific group. Users can do Card, Wallets transfers, and Mobile payments  


We would like to set it up in the US because that is where we see much greater potential and easy to fund raise. What are some of the legal requirements and cost estimates for setting it up? Do we need a payment facilitator license? Please let me know some of the things one should factor in / consider in the process.

Thanks."
"['In order to set up your payment gateway in the US, you will need to obtain a payment facilitator license. This license is typically issued by the state(s) that you are operating in, and it will require certain information to be provided, such as your business information, financial information, and customer information. Additionally, it is important to ensure that you are compliant with PCI.\n\nThe cost estimates for setting up the payment gateway will depend on the specific requirements of the state in which you are operating. It is important to research the specific requirements and pricing for each state in which you will be operating. Additionally, you will need to register with the IRS and obtain a tax ID number.\n\nIn terms of other things to consider, you will need to ensure that you have the appropriate infrastructure in place to process payments, such as a payment gateway. Additionally, you will need to ensure that you have a secure system to store customer data and protect it from potential cyber threats. Finally, you will need to ensure that you have an appropriate customer service system in place to answer any questions or address any issues that may arise.\n\nGood luck - seriously. I worked at a company that tried to do this and it was expensive.']"
