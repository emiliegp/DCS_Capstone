KYC/AML API without required user flow

"Anyone know of a KYC/AML screening software that can run checks via documents uploaded through API?  We collect documents for custodial customers (so documents belonging to non-users) so we can't use a service that requires the user to go through a KYC flow.  We just want to upload the identity documents via API and get them screened for KYC/AML purposes.

Thanks in advance"
"[""try Appian. If you're looking for customised features and a quick build time, they're pretty good. Work with BAML and JP generally, but also HSBC and Barclays around KYC AML and new customer onboarding.\n\nWhere are you located?"", 'Really depends on what you’re looking for… if you are looking just for the OCR from the document, do an online search, there might be a lot of free resources… if you’re looking to authenticate the document, try Incode/Accuant/Jumio (although the last might require you to utilize their sdk), there might be others more adequate to your country. If you are looking to sanctions screening, try comply advantage.', 'Try Signzy.com\nIf you need anything feel free to reach out I work there', ""If I understand you right, you need a tool to extract data from identity documents for KYC/AML. If so, then you need an OCR-based solution (optical character recognition). You can find such solutions on the market like parashift or Regula, but here are something you need to know about OCR features:\n\n  \n1) Ready-made solutions can not always be adapted to your flow  \n2) A lot depends on the document formats. For example, if you are going to scan IDs and driver's licenses from different regions, it isn't easy to find software that includes all these formats in one solution. In this case, it's better to turn to [custom OCR development](https://mobidev.biz/blog/ocr-technology-optical-character-recognition-machine-learning), which will cost you less in the long run.  \n3) Traditional OCR tools can make a lot of mistakes, so I advise you to look at those using AI\n\n  \nI hope this helps."", 'Ended up going with MetaMap.
