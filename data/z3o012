How to reverse engineer card nickname on Teller
2022-11-25 03:17:10
"Hi all - our team likes to use Teller to link credit/debit card info, but it doesn't pull in the card nickname (e.g. it just says Chase instead of ""Chase Sapphire Reserve""). Plaid does this but the system is unstable.

Has anyone figured out a way to figure out the card nickname on Teller using the information you can currently pull from it? If not, any other suggested options besides Plaid?

Thanks in advance!"
