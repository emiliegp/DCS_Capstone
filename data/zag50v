"Traditional banks build trust with time, large infrastructure etc. Even though slow they adapt digital banking pretty well. What exact need to human being are NEO banks fulfilling in reality?"
"[""Great question in my opinion. Most users still distrust such an innovative model as neobanking. Here are some advice on how you can increase the credibility of your business in the eyes of potential customers:  \n\r  \n1) Get all necessary banking licenses to show that you are an official institution and clients can trust you with money.\r  \n2) Demonstrate the experience of your customers whenever possible. Success stories motivate and lower barriers of distrust. These can be video reviews, for example.  \n3) Invest in marketing to be in the information space of potential customers. We subconsciously trust brands we've heard about more.  \n4) Partner with a traditional bank on favorable terms for both parties. In this way, you will be able to gain the reputation of a reliable institution, and the bank will be able to expand its list of services.\n\nHope it helps."", 'One of the main advantages of Neobanks is their focus on providing a seamless and intuitive digital experience for their customers. This can include features such as mobile and online banking apps, real-time notifications and alerts, and 24/7 customer support.
