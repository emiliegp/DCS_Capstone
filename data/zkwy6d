What’s in your PFM tools?

"PFM apps are built in all different shapes and sizes with various benefits. I have yet to see one that effectively addresses the majority of personal financial matters. You may need a dozen apps to meet your needs and wants. 

Maybe you are simple with your finances and just check your bank (ie Chase), investment (ie Schwab), and/or credit score apps (ie Credit Karma), or maybe you’re detailed with your budgets and financial planning so you regularly check and maintain your Mint.com, YNAB, RocketMoney, or a financial planning app. 

What is the best part about the app or tool that you use? Is it the ability to see all of your assets on one system? Is it the ability to organize and categorize your accounts or transactions? Is it the ability to project your finances and understand if you are on track toward accomplishing some goals? Is it automation?

For me, I use Schwab and some credit card apps to see my accounts and transactions. Then once a month, I sit down and update my Quicken budget. Then once a year, I update my financial plan and taxes. Then I always think “damn I wish I did XYZ differently.” I hate it."
"['I use [Mint.com](https://Mint.com). Overall it is good but it is full of offers and advertisements. I am still looking for that perfect PFM.', ""I like Mint also, but it requires a lot of time to maintain. And other than the day-to-day bookkeeping / budgeting. It doesn't help with long-term planning or investing. Do you use anything else for that?"", 'Not yet.']"
