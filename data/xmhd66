Switching to Fintech roles.
2022-09-24 13:08:06
"Simply put I'm a Finance undergraduate and have been working in the finance field. Currently I'm pursuing my FRM certification and will complete it by May of 2023. In January I'm gonna be enrolled in Financial Engineering Degree. I'm interested more on finance side of fintech with finance heavy roles along with minor technical requirement such as machine learning & data optimization and analysis. 
My question is what type of jobs/roles would be most suitable for me and what job roles would I be hired for?
Please let me know. Every comment and feedback is appreciated. 
Cheers & Thanks!"
"['Machine learning, data analysis, and finance are all their own roles in several fintechs - so it’s unlikely that you’ll find a role that requires or is involved in *all* of these things. \n\nHaving said that, there are sometimes Finance Data (Scientist) roles which have elements of analysis and financial modeling. \n\n(Source: I work for a fintech in a data role)', ""So basically I can get either of these roles which will be centric to one aspect of the Financial Engineering? Right? The role of finance data scientist is the only one that shall include all? \nMoreover I can get a role in FinTech even though I don't have former undergraduate degree in Engineering right?""]"
