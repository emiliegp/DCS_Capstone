What solution to use for processing high volume of loan applications?

"My team has to process as many as 90-100 loan applications a day. We tried doing this manually at first but it would take us hours just to validate the info on the forms we were receiving. Also, fillable PDFs have been a hassle for our clients and there's an error in almost every application. Someone suggested an OCR solution and we've been using Ocrolus for a couple months, but still find ourselves doing manual checks as OCR is pretty error-prone as well.

Looking for a solution that can 1) process a high volume of loan applications  2) doesn't require manual checking to validate the info and 3) can be synced to send info directly to our client database."

Much better than OCR (you start with the data and put it on a PDF and core banking system, not the other way around) and easily adaptable to any process.', ""Well, you really need an OCR-based solution, but this OCR needs to be powered by machine learning to provide a better output. The truth is that OCR is quite a complicated solution and it's impossible to build software for every purpose. Out-of-the-box OCR is usually tailored for specific tasks (ID recognition, receipt recognition), you will need customization to meet your business needs.""]"
