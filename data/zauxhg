"Which ""fintech"" solution for payment from smartphone to retailers?"

"Gents,  
My start-up is to receive funds from individuals who buy e-vouchers with their credit cards. Funds sit in the company's bank account until the voucher is presented to a retailer. Payment to retailer is made via smartphone only, where retailer would scan a barcode or QR code for example. Funds shall be immediately transferred to retailer as if it was a cc payment.

Which pro banking solution do you recommend to enable smartphone payment with a simple scan?  
I'm based in Europe but I'm open to an American solution if it answered my need best.

Thanks all."
