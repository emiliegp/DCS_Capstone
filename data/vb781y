Will a minor in CIS with my finance degree help
2022-06-13 18:17:20
I am going to be starting my 3rd year in college and I have declared my major as Finance. Will getting a minor in CIS help with breaking into fintech? Or should I choose a minor like economics and enroll into a coding boot camp after I graduate?
"[""CIS. No one gives a shit about minors so economics won't really provide any value."", 'Have you considered data analytics? That jives well with finance. Use the Moocs to learn coding.', 'Agreed. I assume a decent familiarity with econ from a finance major, while coding is a plus.']"
