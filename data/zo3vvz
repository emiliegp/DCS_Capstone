"Im panning to join for MSC Fintech in uk and i found that course in University of exeter but majority of its modules come under economic background and i notied that its a finance and economic mix of modules. idk how that work. My desired role is finanacial analyst and currently im doing acca so im looking for fintech mastes which complementing both acca and my job role as analyst.

What are some universities that offer this course with pretty good course modules."
