"Hi team r/fintech,

I/we (mostly our small team!) have just created and released a brand new version of our money-building app, **Lumio**. We spent 12 months speaking to hundreds of customers (some of you Redditors!) about the pains and problems you face when managing your money. So, thanks to your help, Lumio 2.0 is now out there to helping you track all your money and save every penny you can actually afford. 

If you're interested, I would love to hear your feedback. Looking forward to creating more features you would like to see!
