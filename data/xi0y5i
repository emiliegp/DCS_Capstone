"Say [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) is a 5 people team, but they have a fully functional payment processing service that works well for all online websites.

Now imagine they are trying to pitch a company (it could be a hospitality business like [Bookings.com](https://bookings.com/) or an e-commerce company like Gymshark).

Which company depart would they reach out to? Is it the CTO or R&D department? Is it CMO or the marketing department? Or is it anything else?

All perspectives are fully welcomed,

And thanks for taking the time :))"
