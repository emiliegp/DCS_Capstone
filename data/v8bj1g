Adyen - onboarding documentation required for high-restrictive merchants
2022-06-09 17:44:12
Does anyone have any idea of what Adyen requires in terms of documentation when it comes to onboarding high-restrictive merchants? Is the merchant required to provide a legal opinion or other evidence that it complies with applicable law?
['why are you going with Adyen for high risk? AFAIK they donâ€™t allow many high risk folks']
