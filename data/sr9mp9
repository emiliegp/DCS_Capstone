Is Fintech disrupting commercial banking and lending?

"I invest in startups and public companies and fintech has always been my biggest focus. I have seen financial services getting disrupted by companies like Stripe, Robinhood, Square, Metromile, Klarna, Brex, Lemonade,  etc. One thing I have noticed is that I have yet to see a fintech startup disrupting commercial lending. One of my friends recently applied for a commercial loan and the amount of paperwork and lack of streamlined procedures was mind-boggling. This is from a top tier traditional bank. I think this is an area that is ripe for disruption. Are there any fintechs working in commercial lending?"
"['Yes sir. We are after that space. \n\nThere was an 173% increase in Fintech investment last year and $1.2B invested last week. \n\nThe drums of change are coming. If your open to a one pager, deck or pitch I can dm you.', 'I work specifically in this space of fintech. I’ll tell you that the biggest problem here is how creative lenders need to get in order to secure commercial business. That, and we are talking about large dollar figures. Lenders want to have their hands all up in the process all the time.', 'Bank paperwork is getting better but still way behind the times.\n\nBanks will still have the inside lane because of their competitive price advantage.', 'Pipe?', 'There are a few in the space, depending on the type of loan.  We focus primarily on the distribution of those loans, rather than the loans themselves, but I can tell you that this is for sure a massive opportunity.', ""Yeah the bureaucratic side is one major hurdle, with P2P's there's a lack of govt protection or insurance which makes it even harder."", 'Kanmon.', 'yes - the company i work for specializes in smaller ticket SMB loans ($15k-$1M)\n\nwe provide banks with a workflow platform to automate and streamline their origination process. we also build and manage the front end applications to make a 7+ day process a 24 hour process\n\nwe also offer a “second look” program to help banks serve more customers that they aren’t comfortable lending to by providing loans using our own balance sheet. pretty interesting stuff.', 'Please send to me as well', 'Please DM me a 1-pager!', 'I’ll take a one pager too', 'Yes, please', 'Go Jake 🚀🔥👏', 'Me too please!', 'I’d love to see the one pager as well!', 'could i please have the 1 pager?', 'Let me see em! Dmd you!', 'Hi I’d be interested to see a pitch deck or teaser as an angel investor.', 'Interested! Please send one pager', ""Hey, late finding this, but I'm curious on what ways you are referring to getting creative?"", 'Part of that can be because of the sheer amount of entities tied to one company.', 'Banks can hardly exist without 3rd party lending opportunities. Its approximately 50% of one independents $450mm in originations.', 'Which company is this?', 'Sent a DM', 'Sent a DM', 'Sent a DM', 'Sent a DM', "">thatonebabyhawk\n\nHey, I can't seem to dm you for some reason?

One bank\'s outsourcing loan numbers is not the industry.\n\nAs a general rule of thumb, Banks like ""A"" deals. If third Party lenders are involved it\'s most likely because they are outsourcing the loans they don\'t want.', 'We were just acquired by Amount and are now “Amount Small Business”, former name “Linear Financial Technologies”', 'Hi can you DM me a 1-pager as well', 'Which LMS do you use?', 'what does LMS stand for?', 'Loan management system/software', 'We built our platform using CASE Center']"
