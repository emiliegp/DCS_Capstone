"['Really I have $500,000 and I’m not a doctor', 'They’re not hiring you unless you have a CS degree and a knack for finance. And those people shit gold right now, you wouldn’t really need this offer anyways if you fit the qualifications.', ""And they want you for a decade to pay anything off. That's eternity anymore.""]"
