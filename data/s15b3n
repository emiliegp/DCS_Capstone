Two major embedded finance models for banks.

"[Accenture](https://www.linkedin.com/company/accenture/) estimates that as the digital platforms start to offer embedded banking services, two major models will emerge.  


Pass-through Services -- Platform serves as a gateway to existing, third party everyday banking services.  


Platform-branded Services -- Everyday banking services offered by the platform under its own name.  


Pass-through services -- in this model, the digital platform sees its value proposition as giving customers easy access to bank-branded financial services where they need them most in the flow of business activities.  


Several banks, fintechs, and other parties will be able to connect to the platform and offer their services via APIs. For example, users of the [Xero](https://www.linkedin.com/company/xero/) cloud accounting software can access financial services, including business loans and finance, to help run their business on the Xero app store. We anticipate that bigtech platforms like [Google](https://www.linkedin.com/company/google/) and [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/) may opt for the pass-through model or a middle-round approach.  


Platform-branded services -- in this model, the digital platform offers an embedded finance service as part of its own offering. The service will be seamlessly integrated into the platform’s user experience and its other services. The platform is in control of the user experience and the pricing of the product or service. In practice, the digital platform will partner with a bank or fintech to deliver the financial offering, often co-creating new solutions that solve SME pain points.  


The expectation is that this model delivers ‘value add’ which can be monetized. Accenture believes smaller and more focused digital platforms—such as finance management and ride-hailing or gig-economy platforms—are more likely to follow this platform-branded model to increase their customer utility and stickiness. QuickBooks Cash is an example. It is a free-to-open business banking account with high-yield interest on all balances, provided by Intuit in partnership with Green Dot Bank.  


The plays are not mutually exclusive. Some platforms may use different models for different financial products and services. Others may adopt a hybrid model, such as co-branding embedded services or forming exclusive distribution partnerships with selected incumbent banks or fintech providers."
"['Interesting. What do you think will happen to backs w and credit unions?', ""Interesting. We're already seeing banks start to adopt what sounds like pass-through-services except they're offering other banks the ability to embed their services...would that count?"", ""Can I ask - is there a link or do you work at Accenture? I'm trying to find out where this came from?"", 'This is happening', '[https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/s15b3n/comment/hs66wai/?utm\\_source=share&utm\\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/fintech/comments/s15b3n/comment/hs66wai/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)']"
