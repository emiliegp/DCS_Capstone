MBA Internships in Fintech 2023 (NYC)
2022-08-02 10:05:04
"Hey all! I am entering my first year of my two year MBA program and have interests in Fintech. Specifically, I would like to do a product manager or business strategy role for my internship in NYC. 

Some background on me: 26 and worked in banking for two years in Middle Market for one of the big commercial banks. Worked my ass off and got promoted quickly to a relationship manager in a year and a half but quit to immerse myself in tech for 6 months before starting my MBA in a pre MBA internship with a IT consulting firm.

In those 6 months I learned how to code and build applications in the React.JS framework from scratch, design brands, and consult for IT strategy. I am learning where I can align my finance skills/new found technical skills and found Fintech to be a great blend to do that. 

Any recommendations from people who have done similar pivots or MBA internship recommendations in NYC? Anything else I should be learning on the side to make myself more competitive? 

Thanks all!"
