"Hi All and thanks in advance.  

I am trying to exit from my current company.  You may have heard of them they only laid off 900 people in a zoom call. 

I have two first round interviews coming up for series A and a seed round fin tech companies i am interested in.  

Regarding salary and TC i have no idea what I should be asking and what's reasonable.  

The positions are Customer success manager and strategic account manager.  

Both companies are currently less then 100 employees and the recruiters reached out to me.  

Sites i typically rely on like Glassdoor and salary are no help and i know the start up fintech space is very different.  

Does anyone have any idea what my range is or a good site to direct me too to further research?

Thank you!"
['I’d stay 1000 miles away from that company. \n\nTC would depend on your level and company’s funding. Also tech and non-tech would look very different. \n\nWe’re working on data for FinTech specifically to publish this information in April. \n\nHappy to do 1:1 to chat more about TC.']
