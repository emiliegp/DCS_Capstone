EU/UK Trusted Beneficiary detailed definition
2022-12-15 01:12:14
"I'm looking for appropriate regulation and opinions from the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority) to understand the precise definition of a Trusted Beneficiary.  Within regulation article 13 lays out a high level definition but it doesn't answer my question of what needs to be stored to constitute a TB.

Is anyone able to link to appropriate guidance please?

The definition will help with regard to information stored against a trusted beneficiary record to take advantage of the exemptions to applying SCA."
