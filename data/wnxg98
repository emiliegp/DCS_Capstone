"I am curious to know if there is any fintech company that allows me to link my fintech card (physical or virtual) to multiple bank accounts.

Lets say i have signed for a fintech company X and connects my 2 bank accounts (BankA and BankB). Now, i want to use my accountA for personal spending and accountB for business while using one physical card (provided by fintech X).

I'm new to fintech space, dont even know if its even possible to connect multiple bank accounts and then switching them as per my needs. Any guidance would be highly appreciated."
"['Curve?', '“Fintech cards” are backed by regular banks. Why would you want to link your “fintech card” to another bank?', 'Used to be a card that would reprogram itself to be NFC and or swipe, with a digital display for which of your other cards it was pretending to be.\n\nIt only worked in a subset of terminals and since you couldn’t count on it, you couldn’t leave other cards behind.\n\nThey gave up.\n\nThe polymorphic card was called Coin, weirdly enough:\n\nhttps://www.macrumors.com/2017/02/01/coin-shutdown-services-february-28/', 'Thanks. \n\nJust for the confirmation, their virtual card works similar to their physical card, right? like i can bind multiple accounts/cards to the Curve virtual card for contact-less payments?', 'I am actually looking for an aggregator.  My question is can i bind/link multiple bank accounts to my one fintech app?\n\nBy fintech card, i actually mean Curve card (as suggested by u/-L3v1-) and not the regular bank cards like BankA credit card.', 'Interesting product. Thanks for sharing!. Wonder why it didnt hit the mark.\n\nWell, that was more of a hardware product. i am really looking for its software equivalent.', 'Curve doesn\'t really have separate ""physical"" and ""virtual"" cards, I mean technically the card displayed in the app has a different CVV but the numbers are the same as the physical card and they are treated as one card in the app.', 'Gotcha. Thanks alot!']"
