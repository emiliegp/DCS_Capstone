How does moving from a FinTech startup to a traditional bank look on the resume?
2022-07-29 23:21:13
"I’ve been in FinTech for my entire career (6-7 years), across two companies: a large, well-known US fintech; and a lesser-known, startup neobank.

I’m passively exploring external opportunities, namely in Compliance, and it feels like I’m going to be offered a much-higher paying role at a traditional savings bank (60%+ salary).

I’d like to know if anyone on this forum has experienced such a move (FinTech->traditional bank) or if you have any opinions on how such a transition would appear on a resume.

Thanks!"
"['Happens all the time. Pretty standard. Alot of folks like to work for the “innovation” team at the big banks after leaving fintech.', 'There’s a reason why you don’t see a bunch of experienced bankers running off to start fintechs and it’s because they can do the math.', 'Either you couldn’t hack it at a startup or you wanted big bank experience to round out your background.', 'Presumably, you have learned a lot working in fintech and have a very unique perspective compared to the traditional bank staff who see things very differently.', '60%+ salary increase? \n\nSounds like you were getting underpaid in the startup/neobank world', 'Thanks for the response!  I\'m very far along in the interview process at a traditional bank and even the hiring manager and their manager (C-suite) have asked ""why would you want to leave a promising, up-and-coming startup for a traditional bank like us?"".\n\nNow, I gave them the run around of ""a traditional bank has employees with a wealth of knowledge and experience from various FIs, and it provides a great learning opportunity, blah blah blah"". I don\'t know if I even believe the words coming out of my mouth, but it does beg the question ""why?"".', 'Actually, some bankers run fintech startups kinda indirectly. Lots of banks have funds that invest in fintech startups']"
