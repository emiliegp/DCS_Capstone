Decentralization is a commonly misunderstood concept

"Decentralization is important for the following 3 reasons.

1. Centralized networks have problems.

Their ultimate goal is to get the control over the users and 3rd parties' who are over the network. 

Centralized networks do everything to attract more users and third parties as their existence depend on them.

2. Centralized networks set the rules.

As they grow and hit the ceiling the relationship between network participants change. They start setting rules of the game, extract user data and compete with complements. 

E.g. Meta vs Zynga, Google vs Yelp etc.

3. Centralized networks prone to vulnerabilities

Building on top of centralized networks means bait-and-switch for 3rd parties. In addition, users give up privacy, control of their data, and become vulnerable to security breaches.

It is sometimes said that the reason cryptonetwork advocates favor decentralization is to resist government censorship, or because of libertarian political views. But as you can see these are not the main reasons decentralization is important.

What are other reasons you think decentralization is important for?"
"['How does decentralization fix these issues?', ""In the nicest possible way, get an editor, or at least run your articles past someone first. Ideally someone technical, with familiarity with the subject. I dunno who you're writing for, but to someone with a passing familiarly with architectures like this, it comes across as keyword spam at best, and crypto-grifting at worst.""]"
