"['As far as I know one of the biggest challenges is regulation. It changes and there is no single regulatory framework, which significantly complicates the scaling of fintech startups.', 'I think marketing. I actively look for new and interesting fintechs and hardly find them. There’s on I use that I couldn’t find online despite looking for them by company name. No website or marketing material, just that they raised money on crunch base. They do marketing on tik tok, but that’s it. It’s a great service too, I wish more people knew about it. \n\nA company that does marketing for FinTechs would be great. Maybe they only get paid based on how many customers they bring on until a certain criteria is met (ex. Company has 100k users or X amount in revenue), then converts to a contract or something. so it doesn’t cost the startup a fortune', 'Federated identity.']"
