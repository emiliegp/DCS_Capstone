Where the digital wallet companies store the money when I top up?

"I am wondering how the digital payment wallet companies (AliPay, WeChat Pay, Grab Pay…) store the money when I fund the wallet ?

If I have a wallet and fund it with 100$, how these 100$ are hold ? They have like a global bank account where there is all other wallet balance ?

And how come it’s instant transactions (fund or when I buy) ?

They are not bank, right ?

Any resource (books, articles, videos…) to understand the mechanism ?

Many thanks."
"['I didn\'t think you meant crypto by this post so I\'ll answer for non-crypto.\n\nI assume you mean new fintech apps and the like.\n\nYeah, they ""partner"" (aka become a customer firm of) banks who have the relationship with central banks.\n\nThe reason you have instant access is that, whilst settlement of funds does take time depending on the payment schemes in your region - settlement is almost guaranteed once the cash leaves your account. So new techy firms assume the risk and make funds available to you immediately.', 'Depends on where and what the institution is but normally it’s held in banks (for most PSPs/ EMIs) and will be safeguarded (again dependent on region)', 'I believe FBO accounts are involved that “holds” the funds while in the digital(mobile) wallet. Anyone correct me if I’m wrong.', ""They hold it in a general ledger account. It's their money at that point. You buy the crypto, they get your money.\n\nThe ledger of the crypto you buy, is the Blockchain."", 'they take electronic money issuing (EMI) licenses in Europe and Far East']"
