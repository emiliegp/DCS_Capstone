Looking for a tool to aggregate invoices
2022-10-26 15:14:54
"Hi everyone, 

I'm looking for a tool/provider for our SaaS platform, that enables us to aggregate various invoices and let us present only one aggregated invoice to our client in the end.

Example: How Deel (or other similar companies) aggregate all contractors' invoices. The company only has to pay one invoice and then the provider takes care of distributing the right amounts to the right individuals.

Thank you :)"
"[""Unfortunately, I don't know of ready-made products for such a task. Most likely, companies automate such processes internally using custom solutions. If you have an idea and are ready to start such a project, feel free to get in touch. I have previously worked with solutions for the automatic recognition of checks and invoices using OCR. Such a module allows the system to automatically extract data from documents and enter them into the database.""]"
