Question for Master Thesis
2021-11-15 00:02:19
"Hi guys,

Im a master student in Finance and is about to write my thesis.

I have two main subjects thats interest me:

\- Fintech

\- Valuation.

&#x200B;

I did a bit of research trying to find a subject that connected them both.

Unfurtunately, i wasnt able to find something!

&#x200B;

Do anyone have suggestions to a subject?

I was thinking of writing something in the line of the possible use of FinTech to Valuate companies, but i cant find anything about it, so i got a bit scared about it tbh? what do you guys think?"
"['You might not be Master of Finance material if you are asking Reddit for ideas for your thesis.', 'You should use Google scholar and read a few papers with the keywords you are looking for. \n\nOnce you find a theme for your research, pick the literature you are going to use to support the thesis and try to create a question around what you find interesting.\n\nYou could also just talk with your thesis supervisor about good avenues to do your research. Try to understand what areas of research are currently being explored so you have more material to work with.']"
