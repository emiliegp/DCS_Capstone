Depositing and withdrawing money from online platform

"Let's say I want to create an online platform that allows users to deposit their money such as with an online casino or trading platform. How can I create this without charging fees to my clients.

For example, when depositing money onto Plus500, the money is available instantly and charges no fees to the user for deposits and withdrawals. How is Plus500 able to achieve this.

I am based in the UK.

PayPal is another example of this."
"['Plus500 probably covers the cost of these transactions themselves as a loss leader, to have a better UX, and greater adoption.', 'It would probably be helpful to discuss what you want your platform to be used for.  Is your vision creation of a free-to-use PayPal competitor?  Or would the funds be used to pay for user activity on your platform?', 'And you’re able to access your funds immediately because those services are basically giving you a free short term loan. They take on the slight risk that your transfer won’t go through and front you the amount you’re depositing to get you using their services sooner rather than after a transfer clears. Unless you’re using RTP, then it is just instant.', 'That would be the case if it were via traditional bank transfer e.g via BACS clearing, but not the case if using open banking, the provider won’t prefund.']"
