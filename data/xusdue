How to build a fintech which needs Neobank services?

"I have been trying to get information on this but can’t really have much of it.

Do fintech companies develop their own Neobanks from scratch or do they leverage any other neobank service?

How do developers test their application with fake money transactions in their neobank?

I have been trying to get a hold of a service which can provide neobank services but all of them require talking to their sales staff etc. which I’m not getting contacted by.

How should I go about this problem? How do I create my own neobank for my fintech application?"
