"Good evening y'all, I'm looking for any digital bank/ EMI for sending money to a Panama bank account since wise closed my account some time ago and Revolut cannot send money there sadly.
Thanks in advance"
"['Check WorldRemit for sending money', ""3 months late, but check out [Remitly](https://www.remitly.com/ca/en/costa-rica).  \nNote, I don't know where you're sending money *from*, but you can [send money to a TelDollar account in CR,](https://www.remitly.com/ca/en/costa-rica) and I've generally found Remitly to be better than Wise for my use case (Canadian Bank to Philippine GCash \\[fintech digital payments\\])…\xa0lower fees, better exchange rates"", 'Can you use world remit to send money to a bank account there?', ""Just checked it and don't support a bank deposit there....just cash pickup"", 'weird, they support bank transfers in other Central & S. American countries', 'You can check it by yourself.... Some financial institutions seems that have Panamá in a blacklist since Panama papers']"
