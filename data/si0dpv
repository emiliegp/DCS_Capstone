Anybody interested in joining a Fintech mastermind group for founders?
"['Yes', ""Just say yes if you're interested and I'll look to match people up.  Seems group dynamics of about five is good, right?\n\nI'm thinking first by stage and then by vertical?  \n\nMaybe geography??"", 'Yes', 'Sure!', 'Sounds a little elitist. Why not just a Fintech group for founders? And do it on the finnovation slack - https://join.slack.com/t/global-finnovation/shared_invite/zt-7tfs4akn-CBMwwIWvPZVXIpfnf94oKA', 'I’m running couple of these groups for founders already. I’d focus on trust and relationships once you form your initial group. \n\nAlso needs and problems a bit different for pre-seed and series A founders. Same for self funded and VC backed founders. \n\nAlso FinTech is very diverse. Putting trading, and banking in same group wouldn’t make sense. \n\nHappy to chat and compare notes.', 'I thought the idea with the mastermind group is everyone gets to know each other and their businesses. Therefore, it acts as a brain trust extension.']"
