"I have a bachelors in business specializing in management. What’s the best way to break into fin tech? What would be a good certification to get? I currently have my series 7,66, and 63."
"['It sounds like you may have good industry background. That\'s a great start!\n\nFintechs need to marry two difference camps of expertise - industry knowledge and tech knowledge. You likely bring the former to the table even if you don\'t know it yet.\n\nIndustry knowledge can take many forms. It may be specific knowhow of how a complex processes is accomplished. It may be familiarity with the tools and systems that a fintech would need to integrate with. It may be the process a financial services firm goes through to evaluate, down select, and ultimately choose a vendor. A fintech needs to either develop or hire all of that knowledge and more if its to succeed.\n\nTry scheduling 10 conversations with people in and around fintech. If you don\'t know where to find 10 people, start with any network you have. It might be your school\'s alumni network, friends of co-workers, or people you meet at the gym. Once you get one conversation ask, ""who else do you think I should talk with?""\n\nThe goal of the conversations is *not* to get a job. It\'s to deeply understand the problem the fintech solves and how they go about solving it. Be clear about that in your outreach and with yourself. No one likes a bait-and-switch conversation.\n\nYou\'ll likely find that there are gaps in their knowledge - and gaps in yours - and that they\'re different. Have enough conversations and you\'ll start to narrow in on a pattern of where your expertise might be helpful. From there you can ask for a new type of advice - I see XYZ problem that I can help solve, what type of role is responsible for making that happen?\n\nIf talking with people live rather than on Reddit seems intimidating, my best advice is to start. You\'ll be pleasantly surprised how much people want to share and help. The conversations rapidly get easier the more you do. Soon, they become quite a lot of fun.\n\nGood luck!', 'We hosted a session exactly about this topic earlier this month: https://www.awesomefintech.com/events/\n\nI’d start with one simple question about your passion in the intersection of finance and tech. \n\nHere’s a list of FinTech topics you’d want to get up to speed: https://www.awesomefintech.com/term/\n\nFeel free to DM to schedule a 1:1', 'Just use any of the many growing technologies that are invading your industries', ""many fintech's priority goal is to integrate with banks either directly or through banking software providers.  So you'd have valuable knowledge to offer integration teams and product teams"", 'I really like u/kleebeard \'s response. I think this is the best way for someone who isn\'t really sure what they want to be doing in fintech, to get a job in fintech, regardless of their background.\n\nWhat I would suggest is taking that approach and combining it with u/WindyCitySDR_1 \'s suggestion, so that your outreach is more targeted. \n\nSo this sort of outreach for someone already working in private banking / investments/ insurance looking to break into fintech, is to be looking at fintech companies doing private banking (perhaps one of the neobanks?) / investments (again, one of the neobanks? or alternatively, one of the ""institutional for retail"" investment platforms like Percent, Yieldstreet, or Vincent) / insurance (some would argue that fintech and insurtech is different).']"
