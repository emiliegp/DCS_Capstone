"Hello! I'm an App developer incorporated in Estonia and Google Play will only pay me to Estonian IBAN account. I'm looking for some fintech mobile banking app (like Revolut, Monese, Wise etc.) that will offer Estonian IBAN. It can be private account or company, doesn't matter. 

Wasn't able to find any yet. Maybe someone knows?"
"['It gets mentioned on Wise - [https://wise.com/gb/iban/estonia](https://wise.com/gb/iban/estonia) assuming they do.', 'Hey - I run a company called www.integrated.finance - LHV offer this - can hook you up with them direct or can talk to you about how we do it', 'Did you check out Payoneer or Paysera?', 'heard about integrated finance! are you guys only abstracting integration to various banks and layering a BO system on top of it, or is there more to what you do? thanks', 'Yes - we also add functionality and workflows on top of those integrations', 'Thanks! so id have to be contracted directly to one of your integrated bank partners? where can i find more info around the workflows etc?']"
