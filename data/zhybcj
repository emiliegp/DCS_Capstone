"['From what I’m gathering, this is just Walmart attempting to expand further into the “Credit” side of the business world. To me, however, this just sounds like rampant layaway.', 'May I safely assume the interest rate will be horrific?', ""Eesh. I used to be a programmer for the credit department of a large retailer. They evaluate the data to find the lower-income people who are most likely to pay the minimum monthly amount (accumulating the most interest). They then expand the credit limit for those people because they are the most profitable. It's really a dirty business."", 'This is becoming increasingly widespread. It’s super predatory IMO', 'Wow, what a horrible idea to further sink the already lower income families that rely on Walmart for everything. Good thinking Walmart 👍', 'I had an account with One prior to Walmart’s acquisition. It went from awesome to absolute dog shit in a matter of weeks. Don’t go anywhere near this shit. You can read some of the horror stories over at /r/onefinance', 'What a fucking awful idea', 'Used to be stores just offered revolving credit. Now it\'s ""a fintech startup"".', 'The article is most definitely paid by Walmart. They try to make it seem like they are doing this to help people.\n\nMost definitely will prey on the poor and probably their own employees. If they wanted to help people they would raise their employees wages and/or lower prices.', ""Most of this article isn't surprising. I don't know why some of you guys are outraged. The concept of using credit to increase consumer spending has been a thing for as long as the concept of credit has existed.\n\nIf you were around during the days of K-Mart, you would have heard about 'layaway'. It's also why virtually every single company extends credit for its consumers...because extending credit increases spending.\n\nStill, some parts of the article are shocking. This line from the article really surprised me:\n>Retail executives, including Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, have spoken about even wealthier consumers feeling pinched by inflation. About 75% of the retailer’s market share gains in grocery have come from households that make more than $100,000 in the past two quarters.\n\nNow that is surprising, but I guess it shouldn't be. Walmart is everywhere and it is a low cost store. It's probably saturated among lower income households so naturally it's start taking higher income households."", ""If this is successful on a large scale, it will decimate Walmart's customer bases within a few years."", ""[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1JaMRpcDrQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1JaMRpcDrQ)\n\nHere's a really good video on why these companies are ultimately a bad thing. They are all falling over each other right now trying to recruit more and more clients"", 'In a recession, everyone becomes a bank.', 'Why is it normal for my fellow Americans to take loans to buy crap instead of investing their money?', 'Is Walmart that desperate for sales now?', 'What could POSSIBLY go wrong here?', 'haha! Yeah... ask Kmart how that went bro.', 'Not really “fintech” if it’s just a loan lol', 'Sounds like buying on margin, its been a long time but where I have I heard that one before.', 'This is just another way that retailer seek to “build and reinforce  consumer-brand loyalty”\n\n\n2023 - Lay-Away 2.0:\nThat’s exactly what it is - rebranded and revised “Lay-away” business model, in that instead of the purchase being held at the store/retailer until it is fully paid off, what they are now offering you is immediate gratification, b/c the product, that is not yet fully paid for, is actually immediately released to the would-be purchaser \n\nExample:\n1) You agree to buy a $1,000 TV\n2) You choose the “4 monthly payments - same as cash”, wherein you pay $200 at the time of purchase and you agree to $200/ month taken from your bank account on the 1st of the next 4 months\n3) After the 4th monthly ACH-debit to your ckg acct, you now own the TV…. \n4) The process starts all over again, albeit for some other purchase \n5) The consumer slowly becomes conditioned to this cycle of purchase behaviors: up-front partial payment, combined w/ the balance paid over a predictable and relatively short timeframe \n6) The consumer develops a sort of loyalty to the retailer, further solidifying their buying behaviors, of which the retailer helps to reinforce by offering targeted incentives and promotions that keep the symbiotic relationship fresh and relevant', ""If you can't afford to get it and you don't need it then don't buy it!"", 'So they’re trying to compete with PayPal’s pay in 4 and the like? I get my stuff right then. \n\nI don’t want to do layaway especially on stuff from Walmart', '100% chance its going to be worse than payday loans', 'There is typically no interest on these services unless you are using one that has longer payment terms (more than a couple of months)', 'The way most of these work...0% interest as long as you make every payment. If you miss a payment, you get charged 25-29% APR on the ENTIRE borrowed amount. So if you borrow $500, miss one payment and you owe them an extra $150.', 'And the terms will make the interest rate seem reasonable….', 'The industry calls their customers who pay on time and don\'t incur costs ""deadbeats""\n\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadbeat.asp\n\nIn this context I am really happy to be a deadbeat', 'I was really surprised by that the first time something like that involved me. I used to have great credit but during covid i had a meltdown, over-maxed out my credit card, ruined my credit, finally started paying it off several months later just days before they were going cancel my card and then a couple months later they raised my limit after I made a couple minimum monthly payments. I kept thinking: why the hell would they raise my limit after I so thoroughly abused my credit? ooooooooh.. They want me in the hole.', 'It\'s taking the old lay-away concept that some us might remember from K-Mart and Penny\'s and Sears back in the day and then ""enhanced"" with tech-bro ""innovation"" to quietly expand serfdom...\n\nNot only does it trap people in a cycle of debt it allows the collection of interest, plus prices can be increased because now the products are ""more affordable"" with no money down and easy, transparent, extended payment plans.', 'I agree this is a dumb idea but Walmart isn’t where all the blame needs to be if people can’t manage their money. Many will go to buy new crap they don’t need or can’t afford.  A majority of the blame goes to the consumer.', 'Same here. Fuck this company. Fuck Walmart.', 'wait is THAT why they went to shit? I used to think they were great then a few months later it turned to shit.', 'You would be surprised how many business / business models only make money on their financial arm versus their actual product. Amazing for people who have their shit together.', 'Essentially this….  The ole “what was once old is now new” replay', 'yeah, but short-term profits. think of the shareholders!', 'Probably a lack of money to invest. Kind of hard to invest your spare income, if there was never any spare income to begin with', 'how do you invest your money?', ""Oh get off your high horse dweeb.\n\nA massive overwhelming amount of people can't afford to pay for college, houses, cars without loans.\n\nIf you can? Great, nobody gives a shit."", 'You might not. A lot of other people do. Walmarts layaway program was heavily used by poor people for Christmas.', ""It's usually something like 26% with affirm and related services.\n\nPayPals Pay-in-4, and AfterPay didn't have interest charges, however they were quite strict regarding credit approval. AfterPay laughed at my attempt at a $500 purchase for a new windshield the other day because I had no history with them."", 'Good luck with that. Native American exemption from certain laws is hard to beat.', 'I love being a deadbeat! On top of paying my balance off in full every month, I take it one step further: whenever I’m planning on making a large purchase ($3k+), I open one of those credit cards with 18 month 0% interest and a $200 bonus and just pay off the purchase over like a year. Interest free financing and $200 off!', '>\twith tech-bro “innovation” to quietly expand serfdom…\n>\n\nI get that this is r/Technology and thus technology is generally reviled here, but this has nothing to do with tech bros or anything like it. \n\n\nThis is layaway with interest rates, aka personal lines of credit. Nothing special about it except it allows fully vertical integration so parasitical enterprises, such as Walmart, can suck the blood from people in multiple ways. Why make money on *just* the sale when you can also charge 27% interest after a promo period? It also is a common, non-tech bro selling method to mentally trick people into adjusting down the true cost of something. \n\n\nStreaming services and other subscription bullshit do it all the time.', 'Yep, I remember those days. And yea, that sounds exactly on the mark for what I was thinking. I’m normally a fan of capitalism for the most part, but a lot of the concepts and practices being employed lately are just exploitative and wrong.', 'Walmart pays their employees shit and then shows them how to sign up for government assistance. Every American is subsidizing zeal-Mart by paying for their workers’ heating, housing, and food.\n\nThe only consumers I “blame” are the ones who know Wal-Mart is a piece of shit, can afford to go elsewhere, but don’t.', 'I respectfully disagree. A lot of these folks are stuck with wages that aren’t keeping pace with prices of goods and services. And yes, there are ways to increase income (going to school, getting a better paying job, etc.) but that isn’t an option for many. Especially since Walmart has forced out competition for other options. If you go to (pick any rural town in the US) you will see that everyone only shops at Walmart because that’s the only place around. \n\nShould people be buying a new TV every year? Absolutely not, and you are correct in that sense, and this is likely going to be applied more for the new crap as you say. However, that is why marketing practices are developed and work so well. Ads and “discounts” are designed to grab people’s attention and make them think they *need* that new TV. If people are already buying everything at Walmart, then it’s hard (for many) to resist those urges.', 'Yup. I’m also convinced Walmart bought One as a data play to encourage Walmart employees to use One for banking and then figure out employee spending habits so they can see how to suppress wages.', 'So we have money for gas to go to Walmart, we have money to spend and make them the biggest retailer in the world, we have money to pay for property taxes, college loans, all the crap we eat, to buy guns, pay for Netflix and any other crap online but can’t find 300 to invest a month? So we are fine paying 12% on interest and not earning potentially 5%. 5% over 15 years is 400% return on your money!', 'My aunt with 6 kids always used layaway, especially Walmart.', '“Hahahahaha” - AfterPay probably', 'The title literally has ""Fintech startup"" in it. That\'s the ""tech bro"" angle. It\'s all the processes on the backend, the harvesting of consumer data, the creation of apps and services to increase the usage of the programs to capture more consumers.\n\nThe whole tech bro angle is rent-seeking, interest skimming and microtransactions... Those ""innovative"" profit-making mechanisms are used and reused over and over. It\'s a culture of trying to repackage simple economic tools and mechanisms in the form of complex technological apparatuses controlled through obsure means and flashy branding.', '>If you go to (pick any rural town in the US) you will see that everyone only shops at Walmart because that’s the only place around.\n\ndollar general enters the chat', 'Do you suggest these people not pay for gas or food or taxes? And that all of these people buy guns? And then that the 12.99 that Netflix costs is what they should be investing? Back in the day when I was poor, I didn’t even have $300 in total a month leftover after rent, let alone $300 to invest. That’s less than $300 to cover all other expenses. I think a lot of poor people are much less wasteful than you believe.', 'The article is about interest rates for loans on purchases. If you cannot afford then don’t buy! Also now it’s easy to make 80K. There’s plenty of money to be made.', 'Do you live in America? Also, do you know the definition of predatory loan? Also, if it’s so easy to make 80K, why do you think more people don’t? In your opinion: is it because poor people just love being poor? Is it because they’re just all way too lazy to make money? Or is it mostly because of the circumstances of their birth? Do you understand the concept of being spread so thin that any unexpected expensive necessitates taking out a loan so that you don’t either starve, get evicted, lose your job, or go without medical treatment? Do you understand how difficult this makes it for many people to crawl out of poverty?', 'I grew up in Europe and I am also American. I was in NYC for the last 11 years. I am now in Switzerland for the last 5 months. All my fellow Greek friends one way or another they made over 80K. I started with 62K back in 2011 and left with 3-4 times that. I was shocked to see how some kids do a million things instead of studying. When I was young I studied English up to taking the Cambridge Proficiency and then studied to get into college. All my friends have Masters degrees. \n\nThere are many ways to do this in the US and no excuses. One Greek guy I met went to Boston to study. In the begging his parents somewhat helped. At some point due to medical reasons they couldn’t. He then moved to Queens college and got a part time job. He literally worked his ass off…gathered all cash including tips and went paid the college. He was the only one paying full amount. Most had grants, support, loans. The clerk there was asking him…how would you pay? And when he was saying cash they were all stunned! He has a friend with him to help him count 1 dollar bills. This guy now makes 120 easily and has gotten married. He never ever had an issue with money. Most Greeks I know even send money to their parents. My friend sent them 30K. \n\nWhen the minimum is $15 per hour and you can get support to go to college if you are poor then there’s no excuse!!!. I am sorry I understand there are circumstances that can definitely hurt you but some families are just destroyed. There’s no excuse in America for parents not to try and make more money and support their kids. There’s no excuse for kids not to focus on getting good education. Stop taking drugs and focus on doing something with your life.']"
