"I’m an undergrad business graduate from a top 10 school with ~2.5 years in product marketing. I started at IBM as a Product Marketing Manager in Cloud and after a year and a half moved to a faster paced startup in cloud focused on security. 

My dream is to work in fintech. I would love to work for Shopify, Coinbase, SoFi, Stripe, etc in marketing. 

How can I break into the industry? What type of skills do I need? Is it a hard jump from being in Cloud? I have a lot of passion for investing and personal finance."
"['Marketing in Fintech is Sales & Strategy specific to the customer segment targeted, it’s a very rare skill set frankly.\n\nIf you like Crypto assets then your desire and background are probably enough for an interview.\n\nTo become more senior you’ll need to have experience running the campaigns that these firms want to have. My expectation is that they will move away from retail / professional to institutional clients.\n\nYou also need to understand basic financial regulation. What does Basel III / IV mean for crypto? What specific regulations may need to be managed?']"
