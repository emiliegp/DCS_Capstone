Hi I’m at a crossroads in my tech journey. Been a sysadmin/network admin for 6 years now and interested in focusing on something else. Signed up for a fintech bootcamp and wanted to know if it is a lucrative industry and if salary is good? Also I can’t seem to find many job posting in this industry as opposed to something like DevOps. Please help if you can. Thank you in advance
