Self learn ISO20022?
2022-02-21 02:32:37
"I am comfortable with the ISO8583 message spec from an issuer perspective through my current role. I see jobs at Fiserv and similar companies which seem more interested in the ISO20022 messaging spec, but I don't know where to get started learning something like that. For context, I work in product dev on restricted spend programs 

Are there any courses online or projects I could take on to learn and showcase knowledge of ISO20022?"
