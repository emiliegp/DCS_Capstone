"Hey Reddit! 👋

I'm super excited to share **Billow** with you all today. It’s been 2 years in the making! [https://billowfinance.com](https://billowfinance.com)

When I first started budgeting, I found myself battling with Mint, and then later with Truebill and what I eventually realized was: I didn't need a fixed monthly budget because that's just not how my finances worked personally. I did like that these tools automatically imported my transactions and showed me trends, but the budgeting wasn't very useful. Plus, half the time, it categorized things incorrectly! I wanted something more flexible. So, I built Billow!

**What is it?**

It’s a totally-free tool for tracking your spending that doesn’t lock you into basic budgeting templates and instead, gives you the freedom to manage money your way! It’s the most flexible and powerful tool on the market.

Rather than focusing on monthly budgeting templates, Billow provides flexible tools that let you track your spending in whatever way makes sense for you and your finances! Think:

* Monthly spending breakdowns
* Travel Expenses
* Reporting for your small business
* Tracking your family medical expenses
* The sky’s the limit

Billow provides the flexibility of spreadsheets without all the hassle involved. You can even automate your workflow once you get things set up!

**Note**: Billow works best on **laptops and desktops** right now! We don’t recommend using Billow if you’ve only got a phone or a tablet.

**Who is it for?**

👉🏻  If you’ve tried other tools, like Mint, Truebill, YNAB etc but found yourself frustrated because they were too basic, then Billow is for you! 

👉🏻  If you’re the type of person whose importing all of their transactions into excel or google sheets, then Billow is for you!

"['K', 'Checking it out. looks simple enough. One question, will billow categorize any trans or will I have to always do it?', ""Billow doesn't make any assumptions about the categories you want to create, but it does let you set up auto-tagging rules as you see fit!""]"
