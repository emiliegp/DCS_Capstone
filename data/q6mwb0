"Hi all, what news sources do you read to follow the fintech startups? Preferbly something specialized only in fintech -  who got funded, new products etc."
"[""I'm running a Fintech newsletter covering the USA and Europe - you can find news, funding, industry analysis. You can subscribe on https://fintechwave.substack.com/welcome"", 'As someone in this industry, the one that professionals around me seem to care about most is: https://www.pymnts.com/\n\nEverything else is secondary and usually picks up headlines *from there*. \n\n\n\nAnother great list:\nhttps://blog.feedspot.com/fintech_rss_feeds/\n\n\nI would use something like https://siftrss.com/ to filter messages too for things like funding round headlines, ipos, etc. and then have a specific alert for those send an email to me.', 'StrictlyVC follows the funding for all kinds of startupsâ€¦ but still some good Fintech Coverage', 'For daily news, I follow TechCrunch. It also has news according to each area. Secondly, fintech weekly seems to have some interesting updates.']"
