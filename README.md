# Introduction—
  This repository is a culmination of my Computer Science & Digital and Computational Studies Coordinate major at Bowdoin College. During my summer internship, my manager asked for my phone. Though slightly strange, my manager was relatively young, I pride myself on having nothing incriminating on my phone, and I am an open person, so I handed it to him. Immediately, he opened ‘Venmo,’ a service that allows you to “move money between [it] and your bank account[s], so your cash is exactly where you want it, when you want it.” My manager turned to me and said, “If I wanted to, I could drain all of your bank accounts in seconds,” then handed back my phone. I am sure for most of the over 70 million users of Venmo, one can open the app without a password despite having the capability to link up to 4 cards and/or bank accounts. Since then, I have added a password to Venmo, but I have been plagued with one question: why did I hand over my phone knowing it carried the capacity to transfer money when I am so secretive about my credit and debit cards and wallet as a whole?  
  
  Inspired by Cai et. al in "Trends in FinTech Research and Practice: Examining the Trends in FinTech Research and Practice,” I hope to explore the public’s' definition of fintech and how this new term is transforming people's perception of money using the burst algorithm and a corpus of Reddit posts. 
The burst algorithm was first designed by Jon Kleinberg to "extract meaningful structure from document streams that arrive continuously over time" (Kleinberg 2003). Its name stems from its ability to model a certain topic or feature 'burst of activity' within a corpus seen by it "rising sharply in frequency as the topics emerges" (2003). The key distinction when compared to other natural language processing semantic algorithms is Kleinberg’s focus on time and its influence on relevance and opinion. This burst approach works well with a topic like fintech on reddit because through understanding the narrative arc of its popularity in addition to the macro environment, one can understand how events influence public sentiment and understanding. The Reddit userbase can largely be described as early adopters—“open leaders who are widely respected in their social circles” (Ryu 2018)—and the early majority—“those who are deliberate” (2018). Assuming this, I argue that the opinions that are found on Reddit, especially regarding nontaboo topics can accurately describe opinions that will held by the late majority and laggards (2018). 

TODO: Fill in details from conversation with Cai about approach 


# Background—
## Economic Environment:
The "interlinkage of finance and technology has a long history" (Arner 2016); the term 'Fintech' can describe pieces of the financial sector which date back to the late 19th century. Yet, after the Great Recession (2008), "a mindset shift has occurred from a retail customer perspective as to who has the resources and legitimacy to provide financial services" (2016). When more people have trust in Amazon and Google as opposed to Citibank (2016)—the third largest bank in America—a deeper analysis is in order. The financial crisis of 2008 truly transformed how money is managed is the United States and abroad. The bailout out of major banks following the housing bubble burst led to the creation of strict regulation and the recognition that some institutions are ‘too big to fail’— or so “sufficiently integrated into financial networks such that…the government cannot plausibly allow them to fail and, instead…will always intervene to bail them out” (Magnuson 2018). This stringent regulation of conventional banks coincided with the blossoming of fintech which in an academic sense will be defined as a “breed of companies that specialize in providing financial services primarily through technologically enabled mobile and online platforms” (2018). Over the last 14 years, fintech innovation has lowered the barrier of entry into the financial sector, expanded access to services, and challenged traditional understandings of how finance works and who controls it (2018). 

First, it is important to understand the macro environment in which this shift took place to provide a frame of reference for the results of the burst algorithm.

# Limitations & Next Steps--
  I began this project because I wanted to learn more about the environment of finance today and how the transition to more digital means of interacting with money has impacted society. My naivety about the world of finance was a double-edged sword throughout this entire experience, and my background in Computer Science funneled this exploration into project-building process I was comfortable with. As a result, the scope I choose to explore in this Capstone narrowed significantly from my initial brainstorming session. There is a myriad of other angles in which I could have explored public sentiment surrounding fintech, and many facets of the problem I chose to overlook whilst pursuing this project. 

  The biggest limitation to the analysis provided is a deep understanding of fintech’s impact beyond the United States. Throughout my research, one of the key revolutions sparked by the increased market penetration of fintech was the increased access to banking services beyond traditional banks. One of my biggest sources, Cynthia Cai and her recently published an analysis of expert opinions and concerns surrounding Fintech, underscored this point: “there is a considerable gap in investigating the barriers to the adoption of FinTech for vulnerable people, with more research needed that provides theoretical and empirical insights into how adoption can be fostered.” In her paper, she outlined a series of ‘Next Steps’ which greatly influenced the areas I sought to explore through applying the burst algorithm to Reddit post over the last 10 years. One of the obvious limitations of using Reddit post as the public, however, is who is represented on this platform. Most of its users are based in the United States, and I am sure the user demographics do not match those of the broader population. Zooming out further, the impact of fintech can often be trivialized and the true transformative nature minimized when looking at an economy where many people have access to traditional banking. Like underscored in Cai’s paper, it would be incredibly impactful academically to study the positive and negative impacts fintech has on financial inclusion. Ultimately, the burst algorithm is a promising way to begin a more nuanced exploration of how sentiment and awareness about certain topics rise over time. Applying it to other streams of post acquired on platforms that include a wider array of global users could contextualize the findings of this project and uncover how different cultures and regions use and perceive money. 

  TODO: Another facet of fintech that is incredible important is a deeper exploration of Accountability according to the DCS Framework.
