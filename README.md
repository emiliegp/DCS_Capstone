Using the burst algorithm to answer what is fintech and how it is transforming how people perceive and use money.

    This repository is a culmination of my Computer Science, Digital and 
Computational Studies Coordinate major at Bowdoin College. Through the built out
of the burst algorithm implamented by Cai et. al in "Trends in FinTech Research and 
Practice: Examining the Trends in FinTech Research and Practice: Examining the
 Intersection with the Information Systems Field Intersection with the
Information Systems Field," I hope to explore how 'the public' defines fintech 
and how it is transforming people's perception of money. This project and my 
follwoing analysis is informed by experts in the field. 

    The burst algorithm was first desgined by Jon Kleinberg to "extract 
meaningful structure from document streams that arrive continuously over time" 
(Kleinberg 2003). Its name stems from its ability to model a 'burst of 
activity' of certain topics or features "rising sharply in frequency as the 
topics emerges" (2003). The key disticniton here about the brust algorithm as
apose to other natarual prosscessing sementic algorithms is its focus on time 
and its influence on relevence and opinion. This burst approach works well with 
a topic like fintech on reddit becasue through understanding the narrative arc
of its popularity in additon to the macro environment, one can understand how 
particular events transform public sentiment. 
TODO: Fill in details from convestaion with Cai about approach 



Background--
    The "interlinkage of finance and technology has a long history" (Arner 2016);
the term 'Fintech' can describe eras in the fincial sector dating back to the 
late 19th century. Yet, the after the Great Recession, there has been a shift 
in the agency people have over their money and the big actors controlling the 
broader public's money: "a mindset shift has occurred from a retail customer 
perspective as to who has the resources and legitimacy to provide financial 
services" (2016). When more people have trust in Amazon and Google as opposed 
to Citibank (2016)--the third largest bank in America--a deeper analysis is
in order. First, it is important to understand the macro environment in which 
this shift took place to provide a frame of refernece for the results of the 
burst algorithm.
