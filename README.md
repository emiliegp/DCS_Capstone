Introduction—
This repository is a culmination of my Computer Science & Digital and Computational Studies Coordinate major at Bowdoin College. Inspired by Cai et. al in "Trends in FinTech Research and Practice: Examining the Trends in FinTech Research and Practice,” I hope to explore the public’s' definition of fintech and how this new term is transforming people's perception of money using the burst algorithm and a corpus of Reddit posts. 
The burst algorithm was first designed by Jon Kleinberg to "extract meaningful structure from document streams that arrive continuously over time" (Kleinberg 2003). Its name stems from its ability to model a certain topic or feature 'burst of activity' within a corpus seen by it "rising sharply in frequency as the topics emerges" (2003). The key distinction when compared to other natural language processing semantic algorithms is Kleinberg’s focus on time and its influence on relevance and opinion. This burst approach works well with a topic like fintech on reddit because through understanding the narrative arc of its popularity in addition to the macro environment, one can understand how events influence public sentiment and understanding. The Reddit userbase can largely be described as early adopters—“open leaders who are widely respected in their social circles” (Ryu 2018)—and the early majority—“those who are deliberate” (2018). Assuming this, I argue that the opinions that are found on Reddit, especially in regard to nontaboo topics can accurately describe opinions that will held by the late majority and laggards (2018). 

TODO: Fill in details from conversation with Cai about approach 


Background—
Economic Environment:
The "interlinkage of finance and technology has a long history" (Arner 2016); the term 'Fintech' can describe eras in the financial sector dating back to the late 19th century. Yet, after the Great Recession, there has been a shift in the agency people have over their money and the big actors controlling the broader public's money: "a mindset shift has occurred from a retail customer perspective as to who has the resources and legitimacy to provide financial services" (2016). When more people have trust in Amazon and Google as opposed to Citibank (2016)—the third largest bank in America—a deeper analysis is in order. First, it is important to understand the macro environment in which this shift took place to provide a frame of reference for the results of the burst algorithm.
